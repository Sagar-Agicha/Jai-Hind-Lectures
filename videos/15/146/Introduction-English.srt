Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn about * What is LibreOffice Base?

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Prerequisites for using Base

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
What can you do with Base?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
Relational Database basics, Create a new database, Create a table.

6
00:00:20 --> 00:00:25
<b>LibreOffice Base</b> is the database <b>front-end</b> of the <b>LibreOffice suite</b>.

7
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
<b>Base</b> is the equivalent of <b>Microsoft Access</b>.

8
00:00:30 --> 00:00:36
<b>Base</b> is free and open source software, free of cost and free to use and distribute.

9
00:00:37 --> 00:00:40
Let us look at the prerequisites for using 'Base'.

10
00:00:41 --> 00:00:44
Following are the System requirements for Microsoft Windows:

11
00:00:45 --> 00:01:01
<b>Microsoft Windows 2000</b> (Service Pack 4 or higher), <b>XP, Vista</b> or <b>Windows 7</b>, Pentium-compatible PC up to 1.5 Gb available hard disk space.

12
00:01:02 --> 00:01:05
For <b>Ubuntu Linux</b>, here are the System requirements:

13
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
<b>Linux kernel</b> version <b>2.6.18</b> or higher, Pentium-compatible PC.

14
00:01:13 --> 00:01:23
For both, Windows and Linux installation, we require 256 Mb RAM (recommended 512 Mb).

15
00:01:24 --> 00:01:29
For complete system requirements, visit the <b>Libreoffice</b> website.

16
00:01:30 --> 00:01:37
You will also need to install <b>Java Runtime Environment</b> which you can download at the following link.

17
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
Click on the red button in the centre that says 'Free Java Download'.

18
00:01:44 --> 00:01:51
Once the file is downloaded, double-click on it and follow the instructions to install.

19
00:01:52 --> 00:01:55
Let us now look at <b>LibreOffice Base</b> installation:

20
00:01:56 --> 00:02:02
If you have already installed 'LibreOffice Suite' with the <b>complete installation</b> option

21
00:02:03 --> 00:02:11
then you can access LibreOffice Base by clicking on the <b>Start</b> menu at the bottom left of your screen.

22
00:02:12 --> 00:02:20
Click on <b>All Programs</b> and then click on <b>LibreOffice Suite</b>.

23
00:02:21 --> 00:02:23
If you have not installed LibreOffice Suite,

24
00:02:24 --> 00:02:36
you can install <b>Base</b> by visiting the official website and clicking on the green area that says  'Download LibreOffice'.

25
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
Detailed instructions are available in the first tutorial of <b>LibreOffice Suite</b>.

26
00:02:43 --> 00:02:49
Remember, when installing, use the <b>Complete</b> option to install 'Base'.

27
00:02:50 --> 00:02:53
Okay, let us go to the next topic now.

28
00:02:54 --> 00:02:56
What can you do with <b>LibreOffice Base</b>?

29
00:02:57 --> 00:03:01
With Base -  you can store organized data

30
00:03:02 --> 00:03:07
perform data entries and view data using forms

31
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
retrieve information using queries and

32
00:03:12 --> 00:03:16
design and generate nice, printer-ready <b>report</b>s.

33
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
<b>Base</b> helps you to manage databases.

34
00:03:21 --> 00:03:28
As you may know, a database is a group of <b>data, forms, queries</b> and <b>report</b>s.

35
00:03:29 --> 00:03:35
For example, 'Base' can be used to manage <b>Customer Information database</b>s,

36
00:03:36 --> 00:03:46
track <b>sales order</b>s and <b>invoice</b>s, maintain student grade databases or build a <b>library</b> database.

37
00:03:47 --> 00:03:50
Let us now learn about some basics of databases.

38
00:03:51 --> 00:03:55
A database has data stored and organized into <b>table</b>s.

39
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
<b>Table</b>s have individual pieces of data, stored in rows and columns.

40
00:04:03 --> 00:04:14
Such a database is also called a <b>relational database</b> where the tables have <b>relationship</b>s with each other using the columns.

41
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
Let us consider a simple database for a <b>Library</b>.

42
00:04:20 --> 00:04:22
A <b>library</b> can be a collection of <b>Books</b>.

43
00:04:23 --> 00:04:27
And books can be issued to <b>members</b> of the library.

44
00:04:28 --> 00:04:36
A book can have a <b>Title</b>, an <b>Author</b>, a <b>Publisher</b>, Year of publication and a <b>Price</b>.

45
00:04:37 --> 00:04:41
These are called characteristics or <b>attribute</b>s.

46
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
Similarly, a Library member has a <b>Name, Phone number</b> and an <b>Address</b>.

47
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
And the <b>library</b> issues books to its <b>member</b>s only.

48
00:04:54 --> 00:05:01
Now, let us see how we can store this data as individual <b>table</b>s of <b>row</b>s and <b>column</b>s.

49
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
Information about each book can be stored in a <b>Books</b> table,

50
00:05:08 --> 00:05:18
with its attributes becoming the columns: book <b>Title, Author, Publisher, Year of publication</b> and <b>Price</b>.

51
00:05:19 --> 00:05:26
To distinguish each book, let us also add a unique identifier column called <b>BookId</b>.

52
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
This way, we can have two completely different books with the same title.

53
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
Similarly, a <b>Members</b> table can have columns like <b>Name</b> and <b>Phone</b>

54
00:05:40 --> 00:05:46
and a <b>Member Id</b> to uniquely identify or distinguish each member. <pause>

55
00:05:47 --> 00:05:55
And we can track the books issued to members in a third table called <b>BooksIssued</b>.

56
00:05:56 --> 00:06:08
This table will track the book issued, the member, date of issue, date of return, actual date of return, whether checked-in or not.

57
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
We can establish <b>relationship</b>s among these tables, to interlink the data in them.

58
00:06:16 --> 00:06:21
Now, this helps us to manage <b>relational database</b>s.

59
00:06:22 --> 00:06:34
For advanced topics on relational databases, refer to our other tutorials by visiting the website <b>Spoken tutorial.org</b>.

60
00:06:35 --> 00:06:42
Okay, let us now get started with our first <b>Base</b> database called “Library”!

61
00:06:43 --> 00:06:49
To create a new database, let us first open the <b>Base</b> program.

62
00:06:50 --> 00:07:07
Then, click on the <b>Windows</b> <b>Start</b> menu at the bottom left of the screen. Then click on <b>All Programs</b>, then <b>LibreOffice Suite</b> and <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

63
00:07:08 --> 00:07:12
A <b>pop-up window</b> titled <b>Database Wizard</b> opens.

64
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
Click on the <b>Next</b> button to create a new database.

65
00:07:19 --> 00:07:22
Click on the <b>Finish</b> button in the following <b>window</b>.

66
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
This opens a <b>Save As</b> window.

67
00:07:27 --> 00:07:34
Since we are building a <b>Library database</b>, we will type "Library" in the <b>File Name</b> text-box

68
00:07:35 --> 00:07:38
and then click on the <b>Save</b> button.

69
00:07:39 --> 00:07:41
Now, we are in..

70
00:07:42 --> 00:07:45
Next, let us create tables to store data.

71
00:07:46 --> 00:07:53
To create a new table, click the <b>Tables</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left.

72
00:07:54 --> 00:08:04
Click on the '<b>Create Table in Design View'</b> in the <b>Tasks</b> list on the right. This opens another window.

73
00:08:05 --> 00:08:12
Here, type "BookId" as the first column under <b>Field Name</b>.

74
00:08:13 --> 00:08:17
Use the <b>Tab</b> key to move to the <b>Field Type</b> column.

75
00:08:18 --> 00:08:31
Since the <b>BookId</b> will be a different number for each book, select <b>Integer</b> as the <b>Field Type</b> from the drop-down list.

76
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
Change the <b>Field Properties</b> in the bottom section.

77
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Change <b>AutoValue</b> from <b>"No"</b> to <b>"Yes"</b>.

78
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
This field now will uniquely identify each book.

79
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
In other words, this field is also called the <b>Primary Key</b>.

80
00:08:52 --> 00:08:57
Notice the yellow key symbol to the left of the <b>BookId</b> field.

81
00:08:58 --> 00:09:04
Let us see how we can choose <b>Field Types</b> for <b>Field names</b>.

82
00:09:05 --> 00:09:12
Field types can be <b>text, integer, numeric, decimal</b> or <b>date</b>.

83
00:09:13 --> 00:09:21
Use <b>Text</b> for fields that have general information, for example- <b>name, title, address</b>.

84
00:09:22 --> 00:09:29
Use <b>Integer, numeric, decimal</b> for fields that may contain only numbers.

85
00:09:30 --> 00:09:38
For example- use <b>numeric</b> for a field with price information, <b>Integer</b> for years.

86
00:09:39 --> 00:09:42
Let us create the rest of the <b>field</b>s now.

87
00:09:43 --> 00:09:51
<b>Title- Field type: Text, Author-</b>

88
00:09:52 --> 00:09:58
<b>Field type: Text, Published Year-</b>

89
00:09:59 --> 00:10:04
<b>Field type: Integer,</b>

90
00:10:05 --> 00:10:08
<b>Publisher-</b>

91
00:10:09 --> 00:10:10
<b>Field type: Text,</b>

92
00:10:11 --> 00:10:13
<b>Price-</b>

93
00:10:14 --> 00:10:17
<b>Field type: Numeric</b>.

94
00:10:18 --> 00:10:24
Change the <b>Length</b> to <b>5</b> and <b>Decimal places</b> to <b>2</b>.

95
00:10:25 --> 00:10:28
Click the <b>Format example</b> button.

96
00:10:29 --> 00:10:32
This opens the <b>Field Format</b> window.

97
00:10:33 --> 00:10:41
Select <b>Currency</b> from the <b>Category</b> list and  <b>INR</b> from the <b>Format</b> list.

98
00:10:42 --> 00:10:53
Let us choose Rs. 1234.00 that has two decimal places.

99
00:10:54 --> 00:11:01
Notice that the total length is five, inclusive of the two decimal places.

100
00:11:02 --> 00:11:10
Click on the <b>OK</b> button. Now we have created all the columns for the <b>Books</b> table.

101
00:11:11 --> 00:11:13
Let us now <b>save</b> the table.

102
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
Click on the <b>Save</b> icon that is below the <b>File</b> menu.

103
00:11:20 --> 00:11:24
Type "Books" in the <b>Table Name</b> text-box.

104
00:11:25 --> 00:11:35
Note that it is saved in the same location as the database <b>‘Library’</b>, as tables are a part of a database.

105
00:11:36 --> 00:11:38
And click on the <b>OK</b> button.

106
00:11:39 --> 00:11:49
In the next tutorial, we will add data to the <b>Books</b> table and create the <b>Members</b> and <b>BooksIssued</b> tables.

107
00:11:50 --> 00:11:53
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.

108
00:11:54 --> 00:11:57
