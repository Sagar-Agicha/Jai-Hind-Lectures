<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:09
In this tutorial, we will cover <b>Tables</b> and <b>Relationships</b> in <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:15
Here, we will learn about: * adding data to a <b>Table</b>.

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:18
Define and create relationships.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:30
In the previous <b>LibreOffice Base</b> tutorial, we introduced Base, database basics and learnt how to create a database and a table.

6
00:00:31 --> 00:00:41
During the course of the tutorial, we also created an example database called <b>Library</b> and created a '<b>Books' table</b> as well.

7
00:00:42 --> 00:00:50
In this tutorial, we will resume with the <b>Library</b> database and learn how to add data to a table.

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:56
For this, let us invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program.

9
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
For this, we will click on the <b>Start</b> button at the bottom left of the screen,

10
00:01:03 --> 00:01:11
click on <b>All programs</b>, then click on <b>LibreOffice Suite</b> and <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:20
Since we already created the 'Library' database in the last tutorial, this time we will just need to open it.

12
00:01:21 --> 00:01:27
To do so, let us click on the <b>open an existing database file</b> option.

13
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
In the <b>Recently Used</b> drop-down box, our 'Library' database should be visible.

14
00:01:35 --> 00:01:37
So now, click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

15
00:01:38 --> 00:01:49
If you don't see it, we can click on the <b>Open</b> button in the centre to browse to the <b>Windows</b> directory where 'Library database' is saved.

16
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
Once found, click on the filename and click on the <b>Open</b> button.

17
00:01:57 --> 00:02:06
Now, if 'LibreOffice Base' program is already open, we can open the 'Library database' from here.

18
00:02:07 --> 00:02:13
By clicking on the <b>File</b> menu on the top and then clicking on <b>Open</b>.

19
00:02:14 --> 00:02:20
We will browse the Windows directory where the 'Library' database file is saved.

20
00:02:21 --> 00:02:30
Let's click on the file 'Library.odb' and click on the <b>Open</b> button at the bottom.

21
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
Now we are in the <b>Library Database</b>.

22
00:02:35 --> 00:02:41
Let us click on the <b>Tables</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left panel.

23
00:02:42 --> 00:02:47
Notice that the <b>Books</b> table appears in the <b>Tables</b> list on the right panel.

24
00:02:48 --> 00:02:52
Let us now right-click on the <b>Books</b> table.

25
00:02:53 --> 00:02:57
Notice the various options you can choose from here.

26
00:02:58 --> 00:03:03
Let us now click on <b>Open</b> to add data to this table.

27
00:03:04 --> 00:03:09
Alternately, we can also double-click on the table name to open it.

28
00:03:10 --> 00:03:19
A new <b>window</b> opens with the title '<b>Books – Library – LibreOffice Base: Table Data View'</b>.

29
00:03:20 --> 00:03:30
Now we can start entering data into the <b>Books</b> table by typing in values directly into each <b>cell</b>.

30
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
Notice the <b>Bookid</b> column has 'AutoField'.

31
00:03:37 --> 00:03:47
This means <b>Base</b> will assign ascending numbers automatically to each row of data that we insert.

32
00:03:48 --> 00:04:21
Now, let us  input data into the <b>cell</b>s, row by row, as shown on the screen.

33
00:04:22 --> 00:04:28
So, here we have 5 rows of sample data in our <b>table</b> 'Books'.

34
00:04:29 --> 00:04:38
Let us close the window by clicking the <b>File</b> menu on the top and then choosing <b>Close</b>.

35
00:04:39 --> 00:04:41
Here is an assignment for you.

36
00:04:42 --> 00:04:52
Create a <b>Members</b> table that will store information about each member, for example- member name', and phone number.

37
00:04:53 --> 00:04:56
Include the following three fields.

38
00:04:57 --> 00:05:05
<b>Member Id</b> with <b>Field type- Integer</b> and make this the <b>primary key</b>.

39
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
<b>Name</b> with <b>Fieldtype- Text</b>,

40
00:05:10 --> 00:05:14
<b>Phone</b> with <b>Fieldtype- Text</b>.

41
00:05:15 --> 00:05:21
Okay, when you are done, this is how the <b>Members</b> table will look like.

42
00:05:22 --> 00:05:24
Let us close this window.

43
00:05:25 --> 00:05:34
Now let us add 4 sample members into the <b>Members</b> table now as shown on the screen ,

44
00:05:35 --> 00:05:45
just the way we did for the Books table. <pause for 10 seconds>

45
00:05:46 --> 00:05:49
Once done, let us close this window.

46
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
Now, let us go back to the main window and click on the <b>Tables</b> Icon again

47
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
and let us create the third table: <b>Books Issued</b>.

48
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
When done, the <b>Books Issued</b> table will have the following fields:

49
00:06:09 --> 00:06:15
<b>Issue Id, Field type Integer</b> which will be the <b>primary key</b>,

50
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
<b>Book Id, Field type-Integer</b>,

51
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
<b>Member Id, Field type-Integer</b>,

52
00:06:24 --> 00:06:27
<b>Issue Date, Field type- Date</b>,

53
00:06:28 --> 00:06:30
<b>Return Date, Field type-Date</b>,

54
00:06:31 --> 00:06:34
<b>Actual Return Date, Field type- Date</b>,

55
00:06:35 --> 00:06:41
And <b>Checked In, Field type- Yes/No Boolean</b>.

56
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Okay, we have created the <b>Books Issued</b> table.

57
00:06:47 --> 00:06:55
And now, let us add the following sample data into it as you can see on the screen.

58
00:06:56 --> 00:07:16
While this may not make absolute sense right now, we will soon understand what’s happening.

59
00:07:17 --> 00:07:24
Now, we have the three tables in our Library database with sample data also.

60
00:07:25 --> 00:07:30
Let us now learn about defining <b>relationships</b> in the database.

61
00:07:31 --> 00:07:37
So, we created three tables to store three different sets of information.

62
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
<b>Books, Members</b> and Issue of Books to Members.

63
00:07:44 --> 00:07:56
Now we also set up columns to uniquely identify each book, each member and each book issued in these three tables.

64
00:07:57 --> 00:07:59
They are the <b>Primary Key</b>s.

65
00:08:00 --> 00:08:09
One of the various advantages of a <b>primary key</b> is that it helps to establish relationships between tables.

66
00:08:10 --> 00:08:12
But why do we need relationships?

67
00:08:13 --> 00:08:22
Let us look at the <b>Books Issued</b> table. Here, we see the <b>Book-Id</b> and <b>Member-Id</b> fields.

68
00:08:23 --> 00:08:27
They can have any value in the <b>Books Issued</b> table.

69
00:08:28 --> 00:08:37
But, they will need to correspond to the same values as we have in the <b>Books</b> and <b>Members</b> tables respectively.

70
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
So if the book, Macbeth, has its 'Book Id' as 3 in the 'Books' table

71
00:08:45 --> 00:08:55
then by using 3 in the 'Book Id' of the 'Books Issued' table, we will still be referring to the same book.

72
00:08:56 --> 00:09:04
So, to explicitly connect these two tables, we will still need to link them someway.

73
00:09:05 --> 00:09:15
Also, for example- How will you establish that 'Macbeth' was issued to Ravi Kumar on 2nd June 2011?

74
00:09:16 --> 00:09:24
Or how will you ensure that a book is issued to only members of the library and not anyone else?

75
00:09:25 --> 00:09:33
All of these can be achieved by setting up relationships which help interlink the data.

76
00:09:34 --> 00:09:45
We will need to force <b>Base</b> to use values from the 'Books' table and the 'Members' table only, by linking the appropriate fields.

77
00:09:46 --> 00:09:47
Let us see how.

78
00:09:48 --> 00:09:57
In the 'LibreOffice Base' main window, let us click on <b>Tools</b> and then click on <b>Relationships</b>.

79
00:09:58 --> 00:10:02
This opens a small pop-up window.

80
00:10:03 --> 00:10:14
Here, we will select the top most <b>table</b> and click on the <b>Add</b> button and repeat for the other two tables also.

81
00:10:15 --> 00:10:17
Close the pop-up window.

82
00:10:18 --> 00:10:25
Now we see the three tables <b>Books, Books Issued</b> and <b>Members</b> in a line.

83
00:10:26 --> 00:10:34
By clicking, dragging and dropping, let us introduce more space among the tables.

84
00:10:35 --> 00:10:47
Now, let us click on the <b>Book-Id</b> in the <b>Books</b> table and drag and drop it on the <b>Book Id</b> in the <b>Books Issued</b> table.

85
00:10:48 --> 00:10:56
Notice a line connecting these two field names. So there, we have set up one relationship!

86
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
Let us repeat the same for <b>Member-Id</b>.

87
00:11:02 --> 00:11:10
Click on the <b>Member-Id</b> in the <b>Members</b> table and drag and drop it in the <b>Books Issued</b> table.

88
00:11:11 --> 00:11:15
You can see that we just created two relationships.

89
00:11:16 --> 00:11:19
And, this is how we establish relationships

90
00:11:20 --> 00:11:29
And therefore interlink meaningful data stored in various tables in the <b>relational database</b>.

91
00:11:30 --> 00:11:35
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Tables and Relationships in LibreOffice</b>.

92
00:11:36 --> 00:11:44
To summarize, we learned how to: Add data to a table, Define and create relationships.
