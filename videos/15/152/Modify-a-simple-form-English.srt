00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:13
In this tutorial on <b>Modifying a Form</b>, we will learn how to enter data in a <b>form</b>, modify a form.

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:21
In the previous tutorial, we learnt to create a <b>form</b> using <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:28
We created a simple <b>Books</b> data entry form in our example 'Library' database.

5
00:00:29 --> 00:00:38
Let us see how we can enter data into the <b>Books</b> table, using this form.

6
00:00:39 --> 00:00:47
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program, if it's not already open.

7
00:00:48 --> 00:00:51
And open our 'Library' database.

8
00:00:52 --> 00:01:02
If <b>Base</b> is already open then we can open the <b>Library</b> database from here by clicking the <b>Open</b> inside the <b>File</b> menu

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:07
or by clicking the <b>Recent Documents</b> inside the <b>File</b> menu.

10
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
Now we are in the 'Library' Database.

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
Let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left panel.

12
00:01:18 --> 00:01:27
Notice that the 'Books Data entry form', under <b>Forms</b>, is highlighted in the centre of this <b>window</b>.

13
00:01:28 --> 00:01:32
Let us right-click on this form name and click on <b>Open</b>.

14
00:01:33 --> 00:01:44
Now, we see a new window with a blue background, with labels and text boxes corresponding to the <b>field</b>s in the <b>Books</b> table.

15
00:01:45 --> 00:01:55
Let us click on the <b>Tab</b> key to go to each field and as we go to the last, <b>Base</b> opens the next record.

16
00:01:56 --> 00:01:59
This way we can traverse the records.

17
00:02:00 --> 00:02:09
Or we can also use the black triangle icons in the bottom toolbar to navigate among the records.

18
00:02:10 --> 00:02:22
Alternately, to simply go to a particular record, type in the record number in the bottom toolbar and press <b>Enter</b> key or the <b>Tab</b> key.

19
00:02:23 --> 00:02:28
Let us go to the last record which is the fifth.

20
00:02:29 --> 00:02:33
Now, let us add a new record.

21
00:02:34 --> 00:02:45
To do this, click on the <b>New Record</b> icon, that is second right of the <b>Last record</b> icon in the bottom toolbar.

22
00:02:46 --> 00:02:54
Notice that we see empty text boxes and the record number at the bottom says 6.

23
00:02:55 --> 00:03:02
Now we are ready to add a new record with information about a new book.

24
00:03:03 --> 00:03:16
Let us type in 'Paradise Lost' in the <b>Title</b> text box and let us use <b>Tab</b> key to navigate to the next field.

25
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
Let us type in 'John Milton' against <b>Author</b>,

26
00:03:23 --> 00:03:27
'1975' against <b>PublishedYear</b>,

27
00:03:28 --> 00:03:30
'Oxford' against <b>Publisher</b>

28
00:03:31 --> 00:03:35
and 200 against <b>Price</b>.

29
00:03:36 --> 00:03:44
There, we have just entered a new record into the <b>Books</b> table by using the <b>Books Data Entry Form</b>.

30
00:03:45 --> 00:03:46
We will close this window.

31
00:03:47 --> 00:03:52
We can add more records or data in this way.

32
00:03:53 --> 00:04:01
Let us see if <b>Base</b> has updated the <b>Books</b> table with the last record we entered just now.

33
00:04:02 --> 00:04:11
For this, in the LibreOffice Base main window, let us double-click on <b>Books</b> table on the right panel.

34
00:04:12 --> 00:04:17
Notice the new record that we entered through the <b>form</b> here.

35
00:04:18 --> 00:04:22
Okay, we will close this window now.

36
00:04:23 --> 00:04:29
Next, let us learn how to make simple modifications to our <b>form</b>.

37
00:04:30 --> 00:04:36
We will click on the <b>Forms</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left panel.

38
00:04:37 --> 00:04:46
And open the 'Books Data Entry form' for modifying by right-clicking on it and then choosing 'Edit'.

39
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
A familiar window opens now

40
00:04:51 --> 00:05:02
except that if you click on the label <b>title</b>, you will see several small green boxes enclosing the label and the text box.

41
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
This means that we are in the <b>form design window</b>.

42
00:05:08 --> 00:05:16
And we can modify the look and feel of the form and its elements as well as its functionalities.

43
00:05:17 --> 00:05:24
For example, we can change the placement and size of the <b>label</b>s and text-boxes.

44
00:05:25 --> 00:05:27
These are also called <b>properties</b>.

45
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
Double-click on the label <b>Title</b>.

46
00:05:31 --> 00:05:37
This opens a smaller pop-up window called <b>Properties</b>.

47
00:05:38 --> 00:05:47
Notice the various <b>element</b>s here.

48
00:05:48 --> 00:06:00
Now, let us click on the label <b>author</b>, notice that the <b>Properties</b> window refreshes and shows the properties of label <b>Author</b>.

49
00:06:01 --> 00:06:13
So, as we click on various elements on the <b>form</b>, we see that the 'Properties window' refreshes to show the selected element's properties.

50
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
Now, the 'Properties window' title reads as <b>Properties Multiselection</b>.

51
00:06:21 --> 00:06:33
This is because we see that the <b>Author</b> label and its textbox adjacent to it, are encased in one set of green boxes.

52
00:06:34 --> 00:06:43
<b>Base</b> automatically has grouped the labels and corresponding textboxes in the <b>form</b>. We can un-group them.

53
00:06:44 --> 00:06:53
Right-click on the <b>Title</b> label and then click on <b>Group</b> at the bottom, then click on <b>Ungroup</b>.

54
00:06:54 --> 00:07:01
Now we see that the label <b>Title</b> and its text-box have been ungrouped.

55
00:07:02 --> 00:07:09
In this way, we can modify the properties of individual elements on the <b>form</b>.

56
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
Next, let us add a tool tip to the <b>Title</b> text-box.

57
00:07:16 --> 00:07:21
Now, let us scroll to the bottom in the <b>Properties</b> window.

58
00:07:22 --> 00:07:31
Notice the label '<b>Help text'</b> and here, let us type in 'Enter the title of the book here'.

59
00:07:32 --> 00:07:45
Now, let us save the <b>form</b> by clicking on the <b>Save</b> icon, below the <b>File</b> menu, on the top. And we will close this window.

60
00:07:46 --> 00:07:53
Let us now see, how our <b>form</b> looks like after the modification that we made.

61
00:07:54 --> 00:08:02
For this, let us go to the <b>Base</b> main window, click on the <b>Forms</b> icon on the left panel

62
00:08:03 --> 00:08:09
and double-click on 'Books Data Entry Form' on the right panel.

63
00:08:10 --> 00:08:16
Let us point the <b>mouse</b> over the <b>Title</b> label or the text-box.

64
00:08:17 --> 00:08:23
Notice that a tool-tip appears saying 'Enter the title of the book here'.

65
00:08:24 --> 00:08:30
So now, we have learnt how to make a simple modification to our <b>form</b>.

66
00:08:31 --> 00:08:38
We will see how to make more modifications to a form, in the next part of the <b>Base</b> tutorial.

67
00:08:39 --> 00:08:40
Here is an assignment.

68
00:08:41 --> 00:08:45
Create a simple <b>form</b> for the <b>Members</b> table.

69
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Modifying a Form in LibreOffice Base</b>.

70
00:08:52 --> 00:08:59
To summarize, we learned: how to enter data in a form, how to Modify a form.
