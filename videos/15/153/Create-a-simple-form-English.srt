<b>Narration</b>

00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial, we will cover <b>Simple Forms</b> in <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
Here, we will learn the following:

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:13
What is a form?

5
00:00:14 --> 00:00:16
How to create a form using the Wizard

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:26
Using LibreOffice Base, so far, we learnt about creating a <b>database</b> and creating <b>table</b>s where we store the data.

7
00:00:27 --> 00:00:32
But, how do we enter data into the database tables?

8
00:00:33 --> 00:00:41
One way is to directly type in data into the <b>cell</b>s of the tables which we did in the last tutorial.

9
00:00:42 --> 00:00:48
There is another way to enter data swiftly as well as with minimum errors.

10
00:00:49 --> 00:00:59
And that is by using <b>Forms</b>. A <b>form</b> is a <b>front-end</b> or user interface for data entry and editing data.

11
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
For example, a simple form can consist of <b>field</b>s in a <b>table</b>.

12
00:01:06 --> 00:01:14
Let us consider the "Library" database example that we created in the previous tutorials.

13
00:01:15 --> 00:01:20
So, a simple <b>form</b> can consist of the fields in the <b>Books</b> table.

14
00:01:21 --> 00:01:26
And this <b>form</b>, now, can be used to enter data into the <b>Books</b> table.

15
00:01:27 --> 00:01:32
Now, let us learn how to create a <b>form</b>.

16
00:01:33 --> 00:01:37
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program.

17
00:01:38 --> 00:01:56
If <b>Base</b> program is not opened, then we will click on the <b>Start</b> button at the bottom left and then click on <b>All programs</b>. Then click on <b>LibreOffice Suite</b> and then click on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

18
00:01:57 --> 00:02:03
Let us now click on the '<b>open an existing database file'</b> option.

19
00:02:04 --> 00:02:10
In the '<b>Recently Used'</b> drop-down box, our 'Library' database should be visible.

20
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
So now, let us select it and click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

21
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
If <b>LibreOffice Base</b> is already open

22
00:02:21 --> 00:02:35
then we can open the 'Library' database file 'Library.odb' by clicking on the <b>File</b> menu on the top and then clicking on <b>Open</b>.

23
00:02:36 --> 00:02:47
Alternately, click on <b>Recent Documents</b> in the <b>File</b> menu and choose 'Library.odb'.

24
00:02:48 --> 00:02:51
Now, we are in the 'Library' Database.

25
00:02:52 --> 00:03:00
Let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left panel.

26
00:03:01 --> 00:03:11
Notice that there are two ways to create a new <b>form</b>: <b>"Create Form in Design View" and "Use Wizard to create form".</b>

27
00:03:12 --> 00:03:18
Let us click on the second option: <b>Use Wizard to create form</b>.

28
00:03:19 --> 00:03:25
We now see a new <b>window</b> which is similar to the 'LibreOffice Writer' window.

29
00:03:26 --> 00:03:32
And on top of it, we see a pop-up window that says 'Form Wizard'.

30
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
Let’s go through this Wizard to create our first <b>form</b> based on the <b>Books</b> table.

31
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
Notice the 8 <b>steps</b> that we will go through on the left hand side.

32
00:03:46 --> 00:03:52
We are in <b>step 1</b> which is '<b>Field Selection'</b>.

33
00:03:53 --> 00:04:02
And, on the right hand side let us choose <b>Table:Books</b> from the drop-down here that says <b>Tables or queries</b>.

34
00:04:03 --> 00:04:08
Below this, we see a list of <b>Available fields</b> on the left hand side.

35
00:04:09 --> 00:04:13
On the right hand side we see <b>Fields on the form</b>.

36
00:04:14 --> 00:04:20
We will need to move only those <b>field</b>s which we need on the <b>form</b>.

37
00:04:21 --> 00:04:26
For now, let us click on the button with double-arrow mark symbols.

38
00:04:27 --> 00:04:34
Notice that we have moved all the fields from the left to the right.

39
00:04:35 --> 00:04:45
Since we have set up 'BookId' field to auto-generate its own numbers, we don’t need it on the <b>form</b>.

40
00:04:46 --> 00:04:50
So, let us move this field back to the left hand side.

41
00:04:51 --> 00:05:01
Click on <b>BookId</b> on the right hand side and click on the button that has one 'Less than' symbol.

42
00:05:02 --> 00:05:09
OK, let us go to the next step now by clicking on the <b>Next</b> button at the bottom.

43
00:05:10 --> 00:05:20
Step 2. Since we are creating a simple <b>form</b>, let us skip this step for now and simply click on the <b>Next</b> button.

44
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
We are in <b>Step 5</b>. '<b>Arrange controls'</b>.

45
00:05:26 --> 00:05:34
Also notice that in the background window, we see the <b>Books</b> table in an orange background.

46
00:05:35 --> 00:05:43
Let us click on the four icons below the label that says 'Arrangement of the main form'.

47
00:05:44 --> 00:05:56
As we click through, we see the background window changing, in the arrangement of labels and text boxes saying <b>title, author</b> etc.

48
00:05:57 --> 00:06:07
Let us use the first arrangement that says 'Columnar – Labels Left'  and click on the first icon.

49
00:06:08 --> 00:06:16
Here the labels are to the left and the text boxes on the right, just like a typical paper form.

50
00:06:17 --> 00:06:21
Now, let us click on the <b>Next</b> button to proceed.

51
00:06:22 --> 00:06:27
We are on <b>Step 6</b> that says '<b>Set Data Entry'</b>.

52
00:06:28 --> 00:06:32
We will skip this step for now, and go to the next step.

53
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
<b>Step 7. 'Apply Styles'</b>.

54
00:06:36 --> 00:06:44
Notice that the window background colour changes as we click through each colour in the list box.

55
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
Let us choose Ice Blue by clicking on it.

56
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
Now, let us go to the final step.

57
00:06:53 --> 00:06:58
Step 8. Let us now give a name to our <b>form</b>.

58
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
We can follow our own naming conventions.

59
00:07:03 --> 00:07:15
But for now, let us type a descriptive name, 'Books Data Entry Form' in the text box that is below the label <b>‘Name of the form’</b>.

60
00:07:16 --> 00:07:19
Now, how do we want to proceed after creating the form?

61
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Let us 'Work with the form' first.

62
00:07:23 --> 00:07:28
Meaning- we will start using the <b>form</b> for data entry.

63
00:07:29 --> 00:07:36
To change the <b>form</b> design, we can choose '<b>Modify the form'</b> which we will see later.

64
00:07:37 --> 00:07:43
For now, we are done. So, let us click on the <b>Finish</b> button at the bottom.

65
00:07:44 --> 00:07:53
We have now created our first simple <b>form</b> that says '<b>Books Data Entry Form'</b> on the window title.

66
00:07:54 --> 00:08:04
Notice that the text boxes are filled with values that read 'An autobiography', 'Jawaharlal Nehru' etc.

67
00:08:05 --> 00:08:07
Where did these values come from?

68
00:08:08 --> 00:08:16
We typed-in these values directly into the <b>Books</b> table in the previous part of the <b>Base</b> tutorial.

69
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
Now this <b>form</b> is ready to use for data entry.

70
00:08:22 --> 00:08:26
Let us click on the <b>tab</b> keys to go through each value.

71
00:08:27 --> 00:08:36
Notice that the <b>form</b> shows the second book's information and the title is now 'Conquest of self'.

72
00:08:37 --> 00:08:53
We can also go to each book's information, otherwise called 'record', by clicking on the black triangle icon that points to the right, in the <b>Forms Navigation</b> toolbar at the bottom.

73
00:08:54 --> 00:09:00
Notice that the <b>record</b> number 3 of 5 is displayed here.

74
00:09:01 --> 00:09:08
Notice that <b>Base</b> shows tool tips when we point our cursor on these black arrow icons:

75
00:09:09 --> 00:09:15
<b>First Record, Previous Record, Next Record</b> and <b>Last Record</b>.

76
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
We also can use these to traverse through the <b>record</b>s.

77
00:09:22 --> 00:09:26
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Simple Forms in LibreOffice Base</b>.

78
00:09:27 --> 00:09:34
To summarize, we learned: What a <b>form</b> is? How to create a form using the Wizard.
