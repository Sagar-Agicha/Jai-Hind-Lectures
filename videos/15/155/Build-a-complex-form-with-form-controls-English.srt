<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
In this tutorial on <b>Complex Forms</b>, we will learn about:

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:12
Building a complex <b>form</b>. And modifying the form.

4
00:00:13 --> 00:00:21
In the previous tutorial, we learnt how to enter data using forms and how to modify a <b>form</b> using <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

5
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
In this tutorial, let us learn about building a complex <b>form</b>.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:43
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program, if it's not already open

7
00:00:44 --> 00:00:46
and open our <b>Library</b> database.

8
00:00:47 --> 00:00:56
If <b>Base</b> is already open, then we can open the <b>"Library"</b> database from here by clicking <b>Open</b> under <b>File</b> menu

9
00:00:57 --> 00:01:02
or by clicking <b>Recent Documents</b> under <b>File</b> menu.

10
00:01:03 --> 00:01:11
Let us design a new <b>form</b> that will help us track the books, issued to the Library members.

11
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
Let us see how we can design this <b>form</b> as shown in the screen image.

12
00:01:18 --> 00:01:28
Let us go to the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> main window and click on the <b>Forms</b> icon in the <b>Database</b> list on the left panel

13
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
and then click on '<b>Use Wizard to create form'</b>.

14
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
This opens the <b>Forms</b> window and the now familiar wizard on top.

15
00:01:41 --> 00:01:48
We have already gone through this wizard in detail, so we will proceed quickly with it now.

16
00:01:49 --> 00:02:01
In <b>Step 1. Field Selection</b>, let us choose '<b>Tables:BooksIssued'</b> from the drop-down box, beneath the label that says 'Tables or queries'.

17
00:02:02 --> 00:02:09
Let us move all the <b>field</b>s from the left to the right by using the double-arrow button. <pause>

18
00:02:10 --> 00:02:11
Let's click on <b>Next</b>.

19
00:02:12 --> 00:02:19
This is Step 2, but we will skip this step for now and click on the <b>Next</b> button at the bottom.

20
00:02:20 --> 00:02:29
We are in step 5 now. Let us choose the first arrangement 'Columnar – Labels Left' and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

21
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
Let us skip 'Step 6' also by clicking on the <b>Next</b> button.

22
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
'Step 7.' Let us choose <b>Ice blue</b> and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

23
00:02:42 --> 00:02:52
In 'Step 8', let's name the <b>form</b> as 'Books Issued to Members'  <pause>

24
00:02:53 --> 00:02:56
and click on the 'Modify the form' option.

25
00:02:57 --> 00:02:59
Next, click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

26
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
Notice that the wizard pop-up window is gone and we are looking at the <b>Form Design</b> window.

27
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
Here, we are going to make some modifications before we use the <b>form</b> for data entry.

28
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
Let us first <b>Ungroup</b> all the <b>element</b>s we see on the form.

29
00:03:22 --> 00:03:30
We are doing this so that we can <b>edit</b> the properties of individual elements on the form easily.

30
00:03:31 --> 00:03:39
To ungroup all the form elements in one shot, we need to first select all the form elements.

31
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
To do this, let us first open up the <b>Form Design</b> toolbar

32
00:03:46 --> 00:03:55
by clicking on the <b>View</b> menu at the top, then click on <b>Toolbars</b> and then click on <b>Form Design</b>.

33
00:03:56 --> 00:04:04
In this toolbar, let us click once on the <b>mouse</b> pointer icon which is the first and the leftmost icon.

34
00:04:05 --> 00:04:10
We will call this as the <b>Select icon</b> from now on.

35
00:04:11 --> 00:04:17
This is used for selecting <b>form element</b>s by clicking and dragging.

36
00:04:18 --> 00:04:25
Now, let us click on the top left of the form and drag it diagonally to the bottom right.

37
00:04:26 --> 00:04:31
You will now see a rectangle with alternating black and white lines.

38
00:04:32 --> 00:04:37
Let’s make sure, all the form elements are inside this rectangle.

39
00:04:38 --> 00:04:45
We will use this way repeatedly to select groups of form elements.

40
00:04:46 --> 00:04:52
Now we see that all these elements are encased in small green boxes.

41
00:04:53 --> 00:05:01
Now, whatever action we do here, will affect all the elements inside this area uniformly.

42
00:05:02 --> 00:05:07
Now, let us move the <b>mouse pointer</b> on any label here.

43
00:05:08 --> 00:05:17
Notice that the <b>mouse pointer</b> looks like a plus sign over labels and text-boxes.

44
00:05:18 --> 00:05:27
So, let us right-click over a label and click on <b>Group</b> at the bottom and click on 'Ungroup'.

45
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
Let us now type a heading that will sit above all the form elements.

46
00:05:35 --> 00:05:42
For this, let us push down the form elements and then centre them within the <b>form</b>.

47
00:05:43 --> 00:05:49
So, first let us press the down-arrow key about seven times.

48
00:05:50 --> 00:05:56
Then press the right-arrow key about 14 times.

49
00:05:57 --> 00:06:06
Notice that this moves all the selected form elements towards the right and the centre of the <b>form</b>.

50
00:06:07 --> 00:06:13
Now, let us bring the cursor to where we need to type the heading.

51
00:06:14 --> 00:06:20
To do this, let us click on the top left of the form window area

52
00:06:21 --> 00:06:25
and press the <b>Enter</b> key twice.

53
00:06:26 --> 00:06:37
Then press the <b>Tab</b> key four times and then type 'Form to track Books Issued to Members'.

54
00:06:38 --> 00:06:51
Now, as we click on the individual labels and text-boxes, we see that these elements are selected or highlighted individually.

55
00:06:52 --> 00:06:59
Okay, next, let us <b>rename</b> the <b>BookId</b> and <b>MemberId</b> labels on the form.

56
00:07:00 --> 00:07:11
We can do this by double-clicking on <b>BookId</b> label which opens up the now familiar <b>Properties</b> window.

57
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
Against label, type in "Book Title".

58
00:07:18 --> 00:07:24
Now, let us click on the <b>MemberId</b> label on the <b>form</b>.

59
00:07:25 --> 00:07:33
Notice that the 'Properties window' has refreshed and again here, we will type in 'Member Name' against 'Label'.

60
00:07:34 --> 00:07:42
As we press the <b>Tab</b> key, we will notice the new label changes on the form.

61
00:07:43 --> 00:07:48
Next, let us change the font sizes of these elements now.

62
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
Again, let us select all the elements.

63
00:07:54 --> 00:07:58
We will use the click, drag and drop method.

64
00:07:59 --> 00:08:07
And now, we will double-click on any label which in turn will open the 'Properties' window.

65
00:08:08 --> 00:08:17
Let us scroll-down to find <b>Font</b> and click on the square button on its right.

66
00:08:18 --> 00:08:25
In the new pop-up window, let us click on <b>Bold</b> and click on size 8,

67
00:08:26 --> 00:08:28
and let us click on the <b>OK</b> button.

68
00:08:29 --> 00:08:37
Notice that the font has changed to <b>Bold</b> and size 8 across the form now.

69
00:08:38 --> 00:08:44
Next, let us move all the form elements to the centre of the window.

70
00:08:45 --> 00:08:48
For this, we will select all the elements.

71
00:08:49 --> 00:08:59
Now let us click and drag on any label, toward the centre of the <b>Form Design</b> window.

72
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
Now let us <b>save</b> the form

73
00:09:03 --> 00:09:09
and close this window. To see how our form looks like now,

74
00:09:10 --> 00:09:19
let us go to the Base main window and double-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' <b>form</b> on the right panel.

75
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
This opens the form which is ready for data entry use.

76
00:09:26 --> 00:09:30
Now, in this form, we see some sample data.

77
00:09:31 --> 00:09:36
And against <b>Book Title</b> and <b>Member Name</b>, we see some numbers

78
00:09:37 --> 00:09:45
which are really primary numbers in the <b>Books</b> and <b>Members</b> table, but not very friendly values.

79
00:09:46 --> 00:09:49
Would you like to see real names and book titles?

80
00:09:50 --> 00:09:52
And, how do we do this?

81
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
One way is to add a form control called <b>List box</b>.

82
00:09:59 --> 00:10:07
We will see how to add and use a list box and other form controls in the next tutorial.

83
00:10:08 --> 00:10:12
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Complex Forms in LibreOffice Base</b>.

84
00:10:13 --> 00:10:19
To summarize, we learned about: Building a complex form and Modifying the form.
