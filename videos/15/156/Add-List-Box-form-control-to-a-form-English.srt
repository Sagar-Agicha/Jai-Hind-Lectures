<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:03 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:13
In this tutorial, we will learn how to Add a <b>List Box form control</b> to a <b>form</b>.

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:19
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to modify a form using <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

4
00:00:20 --> 00:00:33
We also saw this image of the form that we started creating and modifying in the last tutorial.

5
00:00:34 --> 00:00:44
And once we are done with our design, this is how our <b>form</b> will look like.

6
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
Notice here that we are seeing the first <b>record</b> in the <b>Books Issued</b> <b>Table</b>.

7
00:00:52 --> 00:01:00
And, we are also seeing list boxes with real book titles and member names, instead of 'book Id's and 'member Id's.

8
00:01:01 --> 00:01:10
Here are some push-buttons at the bottom for performing actions like saving a record, undoing the changes etc.

9
00:01:11 --> 00:01:19
So, in this tutorial, we will learn how to add a <b>List box form control</b> to our form.

10
00:01:20 --> 00:01:31
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program, if it's not already open

11
00:01:32 --> 00:01:34
and open our <b>Library</b> database.

12
00:01:35 --> 00:01:44
If <b>Base</b> is already open then we can open the 'Library database' from here by clicking <b>Open</b> under the <b>File</b> menu

13
00:01:45 --> 00:01:49
or by clicking the <b>Recent Documents</b> under the <b>File</b> menu.

14
00:01:50 --> 00:01:53
Now we are in the 'Library database'.

15
00:01:54 --> 00:02:00
Let us open 'Books Issued to Members' <b>form</b> that we created in the last tutorial.

16
00:02:01 --> 00:02:06
To do this, let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon on the left panel.

17
00:02:07 --> 00:02:16
And right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel and then click on <b>edit</b>.

18
00:02:17 --> 00:02:20
We are now in the <b>Form Design</b> window.

19
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Let us first consider the 'Book Title' label.

20
00:02:25 --> 00:02:32
Notice that the text-box here, will only display 'BookId 'numbers which are not friendly on our eyes.

21
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
For us, book titles are friendlier.

22
00:02:37 --> 00:02:47
And so, to display these titles, <b>Base</b> provides some ways and one of the ways is by using a <b>List box form control</b>.

23
00:02:48 --> 00:02:50
Let us see how.

24
00:02:51 --> 00:02:58
For this, let us first remove the text-box adjacent to the <b>Book Title</b> label.

25
00:02:59 --> 00:03:08
We can do this by clicking on the text-box which selects it with the familiar set of green boxes

26
00:03:09 --> 00:03:15
and then by right-clicking and clicking on <b>Cut</b> at the bottom.

27
00:03:16 --> 00:03:19
There, we have removed the text-box.

28
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
Now, we will place a 'List box form control' here.

29
00:03:26 --> 00:03:30
This can be accessed in the <b>Form Controls</b> toolbar.

30
00:03:31 --> 00:03:38
We can bring it up by using the <b>View</b> menu and clicking on the <b>Form Controls</b>.

31
00:03:39 --> 00:04:00
Notice that <b>Base</b> provides us a lot of 'form controls'; let us point our cursor over these icons to read the tool tips.

32
00:04:01 --> 00:04:03
Let us find our list box icon.

33
00:04:04 --> 00:04:10
There it is, let us click just once on this icon.

34
00:04:11 --> 00:04:20
And let us move the <b>mouse</b> pointer into the <b>form</b>; notice that it has changed to a thin plus symbol.

35
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
Now we can draw the 'listbox form control' on our form.

36
00:04:26 --> 00:04:33
For this, we will simply click, drag and drop it on our form.

37
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
Let us place it where we removed the text-box earlier.

38
00:04:39 --> 00:04:47
Notice that a new wizard called 'List Box Wizard' has opened up over the <b>Form design</b> window.

39
00:04:48 --> 00:04:55
Now, this wizard will help us connect the list box to the 'Book title' label.

40
00:04:56 --> 00:04:57
Let us see how.

41
00:04:58 --> 00:05:06
In this wizard, let us first choose the table from where we can get the book titles.

42
00:05:07 --> 00:05:14
We will choose the <b>Books</b> table from the list and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

43
00:05:15 --> 00:05:23
Now, in this window, we need to choose the <b>field</b> that will be displayed in the List box.

44
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
And we know that the <b>Title</b> field stores the book titles.

45
00:05:29 --> 00:05:31
So, let us go to the next step.

46
00:05:32 --> 00:05:36
This final window is where we will do the magic.

47
00:05:37 --> 00:05:40
We will connect the related <b>table</b>s and <b>field</b>s.

48
00:05:41 --> 00:05:51
Look at the field names. The 'Fields in the Value table' on the left are the fields in the 'Books Issued' table.

49
00:05:52 --> 00:05:58
And the 'Fields in the list table' on the right are the fields in the 'Books' table.

50
00:05:59 --> 00:06:09
We also know that 'book id' is the key field in the 'books table' and is represented in the 'Books Issued' table.

51
00:06:10 --> 00:06:18
So, we will click on <b>Book id</b> on the left side list that says 'Field from the value table'.

52
00:06:19 --> 00:06:28
Next, we will click on <b>Book id</b> on the right side list that says 'Field from the list table'.

53
00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
Click on the <b>Finish</b> button to close this wizard.

54
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
There, we have connected the related tables and fields.

55
00:06:40 --> 00:06:45
Now, <b>Base</b> will automatically display all the Book titles in this <b>List box</b>.

56
00:06:46 --> 00:06:48
Let us now <b>save</b> the <b>form</b>

57
00:06:49 --> 00:06:51
and close this window.

58
00:06:52 --> 00:06:59
In the next part of the <b>Base</b> tutorial, we will continue adding the rest of the <b>form controls</b> to our form.

59
00:07:00 --> 00:07:05
And this is how our <b>form</b> will look like, when we are done.

60
00:07:06 --> 00:07:07
Here is an assignment.

61
00:07:08 --> 00:07:16
Add a second list box for listing 'member names' instead of unfriendly 'member Ids'.

62
00:07:17 --> 00:07:26
Do not worry about the placement of the list box now. Just draw it to the left of the <b>Member name</b> label.

63
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
We will relocate it appropriately across the 'Member Name' label in our next tutorial.

64
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>List Box Control</b> in <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

65
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
To summarize, we learned how to: Add a 'List Box form control' to a form.
