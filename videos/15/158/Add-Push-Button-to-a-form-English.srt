<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:09
In this tutorial, we will learn how to add a <b>Push Button</b> to a <b>form</b>.

3
00:00:10 --> 00:00:16
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to add a <b>list box form control</b> to a form.

4
00:00:17 --> 00:00:23
Now in this tutorial, we will learn how to add <b>push button</b>s to a <b>form</b>.

5
00:00:24 --> 00:00:35
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program, if it's not already open

6
00:00:36 --> 00:00:44
and open our 'Library' database. You probably know how to open an existing database by now.

7
00:00:45 --> 00:00:51
Click <b>Open</b> under the <b>File</b> menu and choose <b>Library</b> database.

8
00:00:52 --> 00:00:55
Now we are in the <b>Library</b> database.

9
00:00:56 --> 00:01:03
Let us open the 'Books Issued to Members' <b>form</b> that we were working with, in the last tutorial.

10
00:01:04 --> 00:01:08
To do this, let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon on the left panel

11
00:01:09 --> 00:01:15
and then right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel.

12
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
Now click on <b>Edit</b>.

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:22
We are now in the <b>Form Design</b> window.

14
00:01:23 --> 00:01:33
Before we talk about adding <b>Push buttons</b> to our <b>form</b>, let us make some way for the second list box for Member names.

15
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
Remember, we had an assignment of creating the second list box in the previous tutorial.

16
00:01:41 --> 00:01:49
First, let us remove the text-box that is on the right of the <b>Member Name</b> label

17
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
by right-clicking on this text-box and then clicking on <b>Cut</b>.

18
00:01:57 --> 00:01:59
The text-box is deleted.

19
00:02:00 --> 00:02:03
Next, let us arrange the <b>form element</b>s.

20
00:02:04 --> 00:02:14
Since list-boxes need more space than text-boxes, we will push the form elements further down on the form.

21
00:02:15 --> 00:02:16
Here is how we will do it.

22
00:02:17 --> 00:02:25
First let us select all the form elements that are below the <b>Book title</b> label.

23
00:02:26 --> 00:02:31
For this, we will use the click, drag and drop method.

24
00:02:32 --> 00:02:38
Next, let us click on the selected area and drag it vertically down

25
00:02:39 --> 00:02:47
so that there is enough room for the first list-box that is adjacent to the <b>Book Title</b> label.

26
00:02:48 --> 00:03:04
Now, let us repeat the same step for the <b>Member Name</b> label as well.

27
00:03:05 --> 00:03:13
Now, let us click, drag and drop the second list box, that is to the left of the <b>Member Name</b> label

28
00:03:14 --> 00:03:21
and move to its right so that it is aligned with the rest of the form controls nicely.

29
00:03:22 --> 00:03:31
Okay, let us <b>save</b> our work on the <b>form</b> so far by using the keyboard shortcut <b>Control, S</b>.

30
00:03:32 --> 00:03:38
Now, we are ready to add 'Push buttons' to our form.

31
00:03:39 --> 00:03:43
A push button is another example of a form control.

32
00:03:44 --> 00:03:55
We are familiar with <b>OK, Cancel, Next</b> and <b>Finish</b> buttons; these are some examples of Push buttons.

33
00:03:56 --> 00:04:06
With <b>Base</b>, we can add these Push buttons to our form and instruct Base, to perform specific actions when clicked.

34
00:04:07 --> 00:04:13
Again, <b>Save</b> or <b>Undo</b> or <b>Delete</b> are some examples.

35
00:04:14 --> 00:04:16
Let us see how.

36
00:04:17 --> 00:04:29
Let us now add four push buttons to our form, below all the other form elements, just as in the image shown here.

37
00:04:30 --> 00:04:34
To do this, let us go back to our <b>Form Design</b> window.

38
00:04:35 --> 00:04:42
And, click once on the <b>Push button</b> icon in the <b>Form Controls</b> toolbar.

39
00:04:43 --> 00:04:49
This icon looks like a button with the word <b>OK</b> on it.

40
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
Notice that the <b>mouse</b> pointer looks like a plus symbol.

41
00:04:57 --> 00:05:09
Now, let us draw our first button on the bottom left, by clicking, dragging and dropping on the form, below all the other elements.

42
00:05:10 --> 00:05:13
And, we will <b>resize</b> it accordingly.

43
00:05:14 --> 00:05:26
Now let us repeat the above step three more times.

44
00:05:27 --> 00:05:34
And now, we have three more buttons, all aligned in one horizontal line.

45
00:05:35 --> 00:05:42
We are done drawing the push buttons on the <b>form</b>; now let us change their labels.

46
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
To do this, double-click on the first button.

47
00:05:49 --> 00:05:58
We now see the <b>Properties</b> window. Here, let us type 'Save Record' against the 'Label'.

48
00:05:59 --> 00:06:05
Now, let us click on the second button on the form.

49
00:06:06 --> 00:06:14
And in the 'Properties window', we will type 'Undo Changes' against the <b>Label</b>.

50
00:06:15 --> 00:06:24
For the third and the fourth buttons, let us type 'Delete Record'

51
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
and 'New Record' respectively.

52
00:06:31 --> 00:06:36
Now, let us define their actions.

53
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
To do this, let us click on 'Save Record' button

54
00:06:43 --> 00:06:50
and in the 'Properties window', let us scroll down until we spot the 'Action' label.

55
00:06:51 --> 00:06:58
Here, we will click on the drop-down list box and click on the <b>Save record</b>.

56
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
Let us follow the same steps for the other three buttons.

57
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
For the <b>Undo Changes</b> button, we will choose the <b>Undo data entry</b> <b>Action</b>.

58
00:07:12 --> 00:07:17
For the <b>Delete Record</b> button, we will choose the <b>Delete Record</b> Action.

59
00:07:18 --> 00:07:24
And for the <b>New Record</b> button, we will choose the <b>New record</b> Action.

60
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
So, now we have added the <b>push buttons</b>.

61
00:07:29 --> 00:07:39
Okay, let us <b>save</b> our <b>form</b> by using the keyboard shortcut <b>Control, S</b> and close this <b>window</b>.

62
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
In the next tutorial, we will go through just three more simple modifications to our form

63
00:07:47 --> 00:07:53
and then we can use the form for data entry and data updates.

64
00:07:54 --> 00:08:05
For example, when a Library member returns a book, we can update this information in the database using this <b>form</b>.

65
00:08:06 --> 00:08:07
Here is an assignment:

66
00:08:08 --> 00:08:17
Add a fifth push button to the form beside the fourth and when used, it should <b>refresh</b> the form.

67
00:08:18 --> 00:08:29
And add 4 narrow push buttons in the next line below. These buttons should  help us navigate through the records.

68
00:08:30 --> 00:08:34
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on 'LibreOffice Base'.

69
00:08:35 --> 00:08:39
To summarize, we learned how to: Add a Push Button to a form.
