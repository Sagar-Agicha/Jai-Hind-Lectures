<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:23
In this tutorial, we will learn how to: create simple queries using the <b>Query wizard</b>. Select fields Set the sorting order of the fields and provide search criteria or conditions for a query.

3
00:00:24 --> 00:00:28
Let us first learn what a <b>query</b> is.

4
00:00:29 --> 00:00:35
A query can be used to get specific information from a database.

5
00:00:36 --> 00:00:47
In other words, we can "query" the database for some data that matches a given criteria.

6
00:00:48 --> 00:00:55
For example, let us consider our familiar 'Library' database example.

7
00:00:56 --> 00:01:03
We have stored information about books and members in our Library database.

8
00:01:04 --> 00:01:11
Now we can query the Library database for all the members of the Library.

9
00:01:12 --> 00:01:20
Or we can query the database for all the books that are not in the Library.

10
00:01:21 --> 00:01:29
Let us see how we can create a simple query using <b>Base</b>.

11
00:01:30 --> 00:01:43
Our example is to list all the members of the 'Library' along with their phone numbers.

12
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
We are in the 'Library' database. You probably know how to open this by now.

13
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
Let us click on the <b>Queries</b> icon on the left panel.

14
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
On the right panel, we see three options.

15
00:02:03 --> 00:02:10
Since we are creating a simple query first, we will choose an easy and fast method.

16
00:02:11 --> 00:02:16
And that is by using a <b>Query Wizard</b>.

17
00:02:17 --> 00:02:27
For creating complex queries, <b>Base</b> provides us with very handy options such as 'Create Query in Design View'

18
00:02:28 --> 00:02:35
and 'Create Query in SQL view' which we will learn about later.

19
00:02:36 --> 00:02:42
For now, let us click on 'Use Wizard to Create Query'.

20
00:02:43 --> 00:02:49
Now, we see a pop-up window that says <b>Query Wizard</b> on the top.

21
00:02:50 --> 00:02:56
On the left, we see 8 steps that we will go through.

22
00:02:57 --> 00:03:02
We are in <b>Step 1 - 'Field Selection'</b>.

23
00:03:03 --> 00:03:10
On the right side, we will see a drop-down box underneath the label <b>Tables</b>.

24
00:03:11 --> 00:03:20
This is where we will select the source of the data that we need from this query.

25
00:03:21 --> 00:03:34
Since our example query is about getting a list of all the members of the Library, we will click on the <b>Tables: Members</b> from the drop-down box.

26
00:03:35 --> 00:03:49
Now, let us double-click on the <b>Name</b> field in the <b>Available fields</b> list on the left and move it to the list box on the right.

27
00:03:50 --> 00:03:59
Next, let us click on the <b>Phone</b> field on the left and move it to the right.

28
00:04:00 --> 00:04:08
Note that to move all the fields to the right, we can use the double-arrow button that points to the right.

29
00:04:09 --> 00:04:14
Now, let us click on the <b>Next</b> button at the bottom.

30
00:04:15 --> 00:04:19
Now we are in <b>Step 2 - Sorting Order</b>.

31
00:04:20 --> 00:04:29
Since the result of our query is a list of members and their phone numbers, we can leave this as it is.

32
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
Or we can order the list by member names.

33
00:04:36 --> 00:04:44
The <b>Base Wizard</b> allows us to sort up to 4 <b>fields</b> in the result list at a time.

34
00:04:45 --> 00:04:50
For now, let us click on the top most drop-down box,

35
00:04:51 --> 00:04:54
And click on <b>Members.Name</b>.

36
00:04:55 --> 00:05:02
We can also choose if we want to sort the names in ascending or descending order.

37
00:05:03 --> 00:05:06
Let us click on the <b>Ascending</b> option

38
00:05:07 --> 00:05:10
and proceed to the next step.

39
00:05:11 --> 00:05:15
<b>Step 3 - Search Conditions</b>.

40
00:05:16 --> 00:05:21
This step will help if we want to limit our result set to some conditions.

41
00:05:22 --> 00:05:33
For example, we can limit the result set to only those members whose name starts with the alphabet R.

42
00:05:34 --> 00:05:44
For this, we will click on the <b>Fields</b> drop-down box and then click on <b>Members.Name</b>.

43
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
Now, click on the <b>Condition</b> drop-down box.

44
00:05:51 --> 00:05:57
Notice the various conditions here.

45
00:05:58 --> 00:06:01
Let us click on <b>like</b>.

46
00:06:02 --> 00:06:12
In the <b>Value</b> text box, let us type in ‘capital R’ and a ‘percentage symbol’.

47
00:06:13 --> 00:06:21
This is how we can introduce simple and complex conditions into our query.

48
00:06:22 --> 00:06:36
Let us now delete the 'R%' from the <b>Value</b> text-box to list all the members and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

49
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
Please note that we have skipped to Step 7.

50
00:06:43 --> 00:06:50
This is because we are creating a simple query from a single <b>table</b>.

51
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
And our query will return details and not summaries.

52
00:06:57 --> 00:07:04
Summary queries show data from aggregate functions and by grouping.

53
00:07:05 --> 00:07:12
Some examples are count of all the members or sum of the prices of all the books.

54
00:07:13 --> 00:07:16
We will learn about these later.

55
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
Okay, now here let us set aliases,

56
00:07:23 --> 00:07:31
meaning- let us provide friendly and descriptive labels or headers in the resulting list.

57
00:07:32 --> 00:07:45
So the 'Name' field can have an alias as 'Member Name' and the 'Phone' field can have an alias as 'Phone Number'.

58
00:07:46 --> 00:07:56
So, let us type in these new aliases in the two text-boxes and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

59
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
Now, we are in <b>Step 8 - the final step</b>.

60
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
Here let us give a nice descriptive name to our simple query.

61
00:08:09 --> 00:08:19
Let us type in 'List of all members and their phone numbers' against the 'Name of the Query’ label.

62
00:08:20 --> 00:08:26
Now, notice that we see an overview of our choices in the wizard.

63
00:08:27 --> 00:08:30
And how do we want to proceed from here?

64
00:08:31 --> 00:08:40
Let us click on the 'Display Query' option on the top right side and click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

65
00:08:41 --> 00:08:51
The <b>wizard window</b> has closed and there is a new window whose title says- 'List of all members and their phone numbers'.

66
00:08:52 --> 00:09:03
Notice that we see all the four members that we originally entered in the <b>Members</b> table along with their phone numbers.

67
00:09:04 --> 00:09:12
Also, we see that this list is arranged alphabetically in ascending order.

68
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
So, this is our first simple query.

69
00:09:18 --> 00:09:20
Here is an assignment.

70
00:09:21 --> 00:09:27
Create a query that will list all the Books in ascending order.

71
00:09:28 --> 00:09:30
Include all fields.

72
00:09:31 --> 00:09:37
Name it as ‘List of all books in the Library’.

73
00:09:38 --> 00:09:44
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Creating Queries using Wizard in LibreOffice Base</b>.

74
00:09:45 --> 00:09:59
To summarize, we learned how to : Create simple queries using the Query wizard, Select fields
<p>Set the sorting order of the fields And provide search criteria or conditions for a query.
