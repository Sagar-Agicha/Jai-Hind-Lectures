<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:11
enter and update data in a <b>form</b>.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:18
In the last tutorial, we learnt how to add <b>form controls</b> to a form.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:26
In this tutorial, let us learn how to enter data and update data using a form.

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:35
Before doing this, let us make just three more modifications to our form design.

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:50
Let us first invoke the <b>LibreOffice Base</b> program, if it's not already open

8
00:00:51 --> 00:00:53
and open our 'Library database'

9
00:00:54 --> 00:00:57
by clicking <b>Open</b> under <b>File</b> menu.

10
00:00:58 --> 00:01:01
Now we are in the Library database.

11
00:01:02 --> 00:01:06
And, we will open the 'Books Issued to Members' form.

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:19
To do this, let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon on the left panel and then right-click on the 'Books Issued to Members' form on the right panel

13
00:01:20 --> 00:01:23
and then click on <b>Edit</b>.

14
00:01:24 --> 00:01:27
We are now in the <b>Form Design</b> window.

15
00:01:28 --> 00:01:35
Here, let us first resize the form, so it looks compact and less imposing.

16
00:01:36 --> 00:01:42
To do this, we will decrease the height and length of our <b>form</b> window.

17
00:01:43 --> 00:01:50
We will do this by clicking, dragging and dropping on the top and sides of the form window.

18
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
Next, let us change the font of the heading on our form.

19
00:01:57 --> 00:02:11
Let us change the font to <b>Arial Black</b> and Size 12 from the <b>Formatting toolbar</b> at the top.

20
00:02:12 --> 00:02:18
Finally, let us look at the <b>Tab Order</b> of the <b>form controls</b>.

21
00:02:19 --> 00:02:28
This helps us to use keyboard tab keys to navigate across the form controls in a particular order.

22
00:02:29 --> 00:02:32
Say, for example, from the top to the bottom.

23
00:02:33 --> 00:02:36
This is called the tab order.

24
00:02:37 --> 00:02:46
Now, <b>Base</b> automatically sets the tab order of the form controls from top to bottom in a form.

25
00:02:47 --> 00:02:59
But since we removed a couple of text boxes and added two new list boxes and four <b>button</b>s, we may have mixed up the tab order.

26
00:03:00 --> 00:03:04
So, we will set it right now.

27
00:03:05 --> 00:03:15
In the <b>Form Design</b> toolbar, usually found at the bottom of the window, we will browse through the icons

28
00:03:16 --> 00:03:24
and find the icon with the tool tip that says 'Activation order'.

29
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Let us click on this icon.

30
00:03:29 --> 00:03:37
Now, we see a small pop-up window with 'Tab Order' as its title.

31
00:03:38 --> 00:03:45
To order these form controls, we can either click, drag and drop the items.

32
00:03:46 --> 00:03:51
Or we can use the 'Move up' or 'Move down' buttons.

33
00:03:52 --> 00:04:03
So, let us set the tab order as shown in the image here. <pause>

34
00:04:04 --> 00:04:11
We are done. So, let us click on the <b>OK</b> button to <b>save</b> these changes.

35
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
Okay, now let us save our form by pressing <b>Control S</b>

36
00:04:19 --> 00:04:23
and then we will close the <b>form</b> window.

37
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
And finally, we are done with our <b>Form</b> design.

38
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
Now, let us test our form.

39
00:04:33 --> 00:04:41
In the main Base window, let us open the 'Books Issued to Members' form by double-clicking on it.

40
00:04:42 --> 00:04:46
Now, the form is open in data entry mode.

41
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
Notice the heading that says 'Form to track Books issued to Members'.

42
00:04:54 --> 00:05:02
And here, we see book titles and member names instead of 'bookIds' and 'memberIds'.

43
00:05:03 --> 00:05:14
Also, this is the first record of the <b>BooksIssued</b> table; we see that 'An Autobiography' is highlighted against the <b>Book</b> title.

44
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
And 'Nisha Sharma' highlighted against the <b>Member name</b>.

45
00:05:21 --> 00:05:24
And we also see the rest of the fields.

46
00:05:25 --> 00:05:44
Now we can traverse through all the records by using the <b>Form Navigation</b> toolbar icons at the bottom.

47
00:05:45 --> 00:05:48
Let us go to the second <b>record</b> now.

48
00:05:49 --> 00:06:00
Here we see that the member Jacob Robin has borrowed the book 'Macbeth' and let us assume now that he is returning the book.

49
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06
So, let us update this information into this record.

50
00:06:07 --> 00:06:16
For this, we will type in the actual return date, for example- 7/7/11

51
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
and check the <b>Checked In</b> field.

52
00:06:21 --> 00:06:29
To <b>save</b> this information, we will press the <b>Save Record</b> button that we put there.

53
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
Notice that the button is greyed out, meaning now it is disabled from use.

54
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
But if we <b>edit</b> this record again then the button gets enabled again.

55
00:06:45 --> 00:06:49
Okay, now let us test the <b>Undo changes</b> button.

56
00:06:50 --> 00:07:05
For this, let us edit the record by clicking on the book title 'Conquest of Self' and then typing in 5/7/11 in the <b>Actual Return Date</b> field.

57
00:07:06 --> 00:07:14
Notice that both the <b>Save record</b> button and the <b>Undo changes</b> button are enabled for use.

58
00:07:15 --> 00:07:21
Now, let us click on the <b>Undo Changes</b> button and see what happens.

59
00:07:22 --> 00:07:36
The changes we did last, have been undone.  Notice that 'Macbeth' is highlighted instead of 'Conquest of Self' and the <b>Actual return date</b> is 7/7/11.

60
00:07:37 --> 00:07:46
Good, let us now click on the <b>Delete Record</b> button, meaning- we are trying to delete this second record.

61
00:07:47 --> 00:07:54
<b>Base</b> is cautious about deletes, so it asks for a confirmation by alerting us.

62
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
For now, let us go ahead and click on the <b>Yes</b> button.

63
00:08:02 --> 00:08:12
We can see that the <b>record</b> is indeed deleted; gone from the screen and in its place we see the next record.

64
00:08:13 --> 00:08:21
Finally, let us add a new record by clicking on the last button on the form which is <b>New record</b>.

65
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
Let us type some values.

66
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
Since the <b>IssueId</b> is an auto generating field, we will skip it.

67
00:08:33 --> 00:08:41
And here, let us add data as shown in the image.

68
00:08:42 --> 00:08:46
To save the entries, click on the <b>Save Record</b> button.

69
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
There we go. We have tested the <b>form</b> by entering and updating data.

70
00:08:54 --> 00:08:59
Here is an assignment- Design a <b>form</b> to show the member's information.

71
00:09:00 --> 00:09:02
Make the form look compact.

72
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
Make the font <b>bold</b>.

73
00:09:07 --> 00:09:09
Add <b>Save</b> and <b>New record</b> buttons.

74
00:09:10 --> 00:09:16
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Form Data in LibreOffice Base</b>.

75
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
To summarize, we learned how to:

76
00:09:20 --> 00:09:22
enter and update data in a <b>form</b>.

77
00:09:23 --> 00:09:33
