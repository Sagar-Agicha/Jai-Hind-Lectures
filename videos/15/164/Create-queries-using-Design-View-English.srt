<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:05
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

3
00:00:06 --> 00:00:09
Create a <b>query</b> by using the <b>Design View</b>.

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:12
Add tables to the <b>Query Design</b> window

5
00:00:13 --> 00:00:22
Select <b>fields</b>, Set up <b>aliases</b>
<p>Set up sorting order and provide search criteria for a <b>query</b>.
</p>

6
00:00:23 --> 00:00:28
For this, let us consider our familiar 'Library' database example.

7
00:00:29 --> 00:00:36
In this 'Library' database, we have stored information about books and members.

8
00:00:37 --> 00:00:44
And, we also have a <b>table</b> to track the books issued to the members.

9
00:00:45 --> 00:00:53
Now we will create a new <b>query</b> to list all the books that have been issued to the members.

10
00:00:54 --> 00:01:02
In other words, let us generate a history of books that have been issued to the members.

11
00:01:03 --> 00:01:06
Let's open the <b>Library</b> database.

12
00:01:07 --> 00:01:12
Let us click on the <b>Queries</b> icon on the left panel.

13
00:01:13 --> 00:01:27
On the right panel, we will click on the ‘Create Query in Design view’. We now see a new window which is also called the <b>Query Design</b> window.

14
00:01:28 --> 00:01:38
And we also see a small pop-up window at the top that says <b>Add Table or Query</b>.

15
00:01:39 --> 00:01:45
Here is where we will define the source of the data for the query.

16
00:01:46 --> 00:01:56
And we will need all the three tables for our query to generate the <b>history</b> of the books issued to members.

17
00:01:57 --> 00:02:10
We will do this by clicking on the <b>Books</b> table in the list and then clicking on the <b>Add</b> button on the right in the <b>pop-up window</b>.

18
00:02:11 --> 00:02:18
We will similarly add the <b>BooksIssued</b> table and the <b>Members table</b>. <pause>

19
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
We now see that the three tables have appeared in the background query design window.

20
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
Let us now close the pop-up window.

21
00:02:31 --> 00:02:38
This brings the <b>Query design window</b> to the foreground.

22
00:02:39 --> 00:02:45
Notice that the three tables are in the top half of the window.

23
00:02:46 --> 00:02:52
Here, let us introduce some space among these tables.

24
00:02:53 --> 00:03:00
Let us click, drag and drop the <b>Members</b> table to the far right.

25
00:03:01 --> 00:03:10
And then click, drag and drop the <b>BooksIssued</b> table to the centre.

26
00:03:11 --> 00:03:22
Now we see lines linking these tables and these are the <b>relationships</b> that we had established earlier.

27
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
We can double-click on the lines to see the <b>relationship</b> details.

28
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
For now, let us see the bottom half of the 'Query design' window.

29
00:03:37 --> 00:03:47
This area has several rows of <b>cell</b>s. As we design the query, we will fill these up.

30
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
First, we will check the <b>Field</b> column.

31
00:03:53 --> 00:04:00
This is for specifying the fields we need to display in the result set.

32
00:04:01 --> 00:04:11
To do this, we will first double-click on the <b>Title</b> field in the <b>Books</b> table in the upper half of the window.

33
00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
Next is the <b>Name</b> field in the <b>Members</b> table.

34
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
And then, the <b>Issue Date</b> field in the <b>BooksIssued</b> table.

35
00:04:24 --> 00:04:33
Next, the <b>Return date,the actual return date</b>. And finally the <b>checked in</b> field.

36
00:04:34 --> 00:04:43
Notice these fields in the bottom half of the window in the first row.

37
00:04:44 --> 00:04:49
Also the corresponding <b>table</b> names in the third row.

38
00:04:50 --> 00:04:56
Next, let us look at the <b>Alias</b> in the second row.

39
00:04:57 --> 00:05:03
This is where we can enter descriptive names for the selected fields.

40
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
So, let us type in aliases as shown in the image. <pause>

41
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
And we are done with the aliases.

42
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
Next, let us look at the <b>Sort</b> row.

43
00:05:21 --> 00:05:25
We can specify the ordering of the <b>result set</b> here.

44
00:05:26 --> 00:05:33
Since we need a <b>history</b> of the books issued, we will order it chronologically.

45
00:05:34 --> 00:05:42
Meaning- we will sort the <b>result set</b> by the <b>Issue Date</b> in ascending order.

46
00:05:43 --> 00:05:55
For this, we will click on the empty <b>cell</b> in the <b>Sort</b> row, under the <b>Issuedate</b> field. And let us click on <b>Ascending</b>.

47
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
Okay, we will go to the next row - <b>‘Visible’</b>.

48
00:06:02 --> 00:06:10
Here, we can set the visibility of the fields we selected by checking or un-checking them.

49
00:06:11 --> 00:06:16
Notice that, by default, all of them are checked.

50
00:06:17 --> 00:06:26
Next, we will go to the <b>‘Function’</b> row. This is used to create complex queries. We will skip this for now

51
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
and we will go to the <b>‘Criterion’</b> row.

52
00:06:32 --> 00:06:39
This is where we can limit the <b>result set</b> to a simple or complex set of criteria.

53
00:06:40 --> 00:06:48
For example, we can <b>query</b> for those books only which were issued but have not been returned by members.

54
00:06:49 --> 00:06:53
Meaning- only those that are not checked-in.

55
00:06:54 --> 00:07:05
So, let us click on the empty <b>cell</b> in this row, under the <b>CheckedIn</b> field and type in ‘Equals Zero’.

56
00:07:06 --> 00:07:09
That's it. Let us <b>run</b> this query now.

57
00:07:10 --> 00:07:26
We can use the keyboard shortcut <b>F5</b> or click on the <b>Edit</b> menu at the top of the window
<p>and then click on <b>Run Query</b> at the bottom.
</p>

58
00:07:27 --> 00:07:31
Can you see some data in the upper half of the window?

59
00:07:32 --> 00:07:35
These are the results of your query.

60
00:07:36 --> 00:07:50
Notice that, we see a <b>history</b> of books issued to members and ordered by <b>Issue Date</b>. Also notice that none of the books are checked-in.

61
00:07:51 --> 00:07:59
Now we can go to the query design area below and change it any way we want .

62
00:08:00 --> 00:08:06
For example, let us remove the <b>Checked In</b> criterion. <pause>

63
00:08:07 --> 00:08:14
Now, let us <b>run</b> the query by pressing <b>F5</b> again.

64
00:08:15 --> 00:08:22
This time we see a longer list of data returned from the query.

65
00:08:23 --> 00:08:33
Next, let us <b>save</b> this query by pressing <b>Control, S</b>. This opens a small pop-up window.

66
00:08:34 --> 00:08:37
Let us give a descriptive name to our query here.

67
00:08:38 --> 00:08:45
Let us type ‘History of Books Issued to Members’

68
00:08:46 --> 00:08:51
and then click on <b>OK</b> button. and close this window.

69
00:08:52 --> 00:09:00
We can open this saved query by double-clicking on the query name in the main <b>Base</b> window.

70
00:09:01 --> 00:09:08
So, there we have successfully created a query using the <b>Design View</b>.

71
00:09:09 --> 00:09:11
Here is an assignment:

72
00:09:12 --> 00:09:23
Generate a list of the books issued to the member Nisha Sharma. The list should be chronological by <b>Issue date</b>.

73
00:09:24 --> 00:09:30
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Creating queries in Design View</b>, in <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

74
00:09:31 --> 00:09:32
To summarize, we learned how to:

75
00:09:33 --> 00:09:40
Create a query by using the Design View, Add tables to the Query Design window, Select fields

76
00:09:41 --> 00:09:48
Set up aliases, Set up sorting order And provide search criteria for a query.

77
00:09:49 --> 00:10:09
