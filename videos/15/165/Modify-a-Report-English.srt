<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:02 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:08
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

3
00:00:09 --> 00:00:15
modify a <b>report</b> by customizing the layout and the look and feel of the report.

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:22
For this, let us consider our familiar <b>Library</b> database example.

5
00:00:23 --> 00:00:27
In the previous tutorial, we learnt how to create a <b>report</b>.

6
00:00:28 --> 00:00:39
And we built a report with the title ‘Books Issued to Members: Report History’. We will now learn how to modify this report.

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:41
In the 'Library' database,

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:46
let us click on the <b>Reports</b> icon on the left panel.

9
00:00:47 --> 00:00:56
On the right panel, we see the ‘Books Issued to Members: Report History’ report in the reports list.

10
00:00:57 --> 00:01:07
Let us right-click on it and then click on <b>Edit</b> to open the report for modifying or editing.

11
00:01:08 --> 00:01:13
We now see a new window which is called the <b>Report Builder</b> window.

12
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
This <b>screen</b> is composed of three main sections.

13
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
<b>Page Header</b> and <b>Footer</b> section that form the top and the bottom.

14
00:01:26 --> 00:01:28
Then the <b>Header</b> section

15
00:01:29 --> 00:01:33
and the <b>Detail</b> section.

16
00:01:34 --> 00:01:39
We can also add a <b>record header</b> and a <b>footer</b> section

17
00:01:40 --> 00:01:50
by right-clicking on the main screen in the white area and clicking on the <b>‘Insert Report Header/Footer’</b>.

18
00:01:51 --> 00:01:59
We can shrink or expand these sections by double-clicking on the orange areas on the left of the screen.

19
00:02:00 --> 00:02:05
Before we move on, here is a screenshot of the <b>Report design</b> window.

20
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
We will modify our report design to look like this.

21
00:02:11 --> 00:02:19
We will add some text labels, fonts, formatting and adjust the spacing among the various sections.

22
00:02:20 --> 00:02:26
Okay, now let us add some report headers and footers.

23
00:02:27 --> 00:02:30
To do this, we will click on the <b>Label Field</b> icon

24
00:02:31 --> 00:02:39
in the <b>Report Controls</b> toolbar, found below the menu bar at the top.

25
00:02:40 --> 00:02:47
Let us draw it on the <b>Report Header</b> area, as being shown now

26
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
and double-click on the <b>Label</b> to bring up its properties on the right.

27
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
Here, let us type: "Books Issued to Members:

28
00:03:00 --> 00:03:06
Report History" against the <b>Label</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

29
00:03:07 --> 00:03:16
Let us also change the font style; we will choose <b>Arial Black</b>, <b>Bold</b> and <b>Size 12</b>

30
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
and click on the <b>OK</b> button.

31
00:03:21 --> 00:03:30
Next, let us add another label to the report footer as shown on the screen. <pause>

32
00:03:31 --> 00:03:41
For example- let's type: "Report Prepared by Assistant Librarian" <pause>

33
00:03:42 --> 00:03:50
and then change the font style to <b>Arial, Bold Italic</b> and <b>Size 8</b>. <pause>

34
00:03:51 --> 00:03:58
Now, we will repeat the same steps again to add a label in the <b>Page Footer</b> area.  <pause>

35
00:03:59 --> 00:04:08
This time, we will type: "Nehru Library, New Delhi" against the label <pause>

36
00:04:09 --> 00:04:19
and change the <b>font style</b> to <b>Arial, Bold Italic</b> and <b>Size 8</b>. <pause>

37
00:04:20 --> 00:04:23
Now, let us adjust the spacing.

38
00:04:24 --> 00:04:36
First, let us reduce the <b>Page Header</b> area by double-clicking on the grey line between the <b>Page Header</b> and <b>Report Header</b>.

39
00:04:37 --> 00:04:46
And we will take it all the way to the top by using the click, drag and drop method.

40
00:04:47 --> 00:04:51
Next, let us reduce the <b>Report header</b> area

41
00:04:52 --> 00:05:00
by double-clicking on the grey line between the report header and the header. <pause>

42
00:05:01 --> 00:05:12
We will repeat the same steps to reduce the spacing between the <b>Report footer</b> and the <b>Page footer</b> also. <pause>

43
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
Next, let us centre the Header labels.

44
00:05:18 --> 00:05:25
We will do this by first selecting all the labels by clicking on the <b>Book Title</b>

45
00:05:26 --> 00:05:34
and then while pressing the <b>Shift</b> key, we will click on the rest of the labels as shown.

46
00:05:35 --> 00:05:40
Now, let us use the up-arrow key to centre them.

47
00:05:41 --> 00:05:46
We will now give the <b>header</b> a light blue background.

48
00:05:47 --> 00:05:54
To do this, we will go to the <b>Properties</b> and change the <b>Background transparent</b> to <b>NO</b>.

49
00:05:55 --> 00:06:02
And then select <b>Blue 8</b> from the list for <b>Background colour</b>.

50
00:06:03 --> 00:06:08
We will do the same with the <b>Detail</b> section as well. <pause>

51
00:06:09 --> 00:06:19
For this, we will first increase the spacing between the <b>Detail</b> and <b>Report footer</b> sections <pause>

52
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
and then centre the fields. <pause>

53
00:06:24 --> 00:06:31
We will select Light gray background for the <b>Detail</b> section as shown. <pause>

54
00:06:32 --> 00:06:38
Next, we will change the data formatting for the <b>Checked In</b> field.

55
00:06:39 --> 00:06:46
Since this holds Boolean values 1 or 0, it displays <b>True</b> or <b>False</b>.

56
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
We will change this to show a friendlier <b>Yes</b> or <b>No</b> option.

57
00:06:53 --> 00:07:00
For this, we will double-click on the <b>CheckedIn</b> field on the right, in the <b>Detail</b> section.

58
00:07:01 --> 00:07:07
Now, in the <b>properties</b> on the right, let us click on the <b>Data</b> tab first.

59
00:07:08 --> 00:07:14
Let us click on the button next to the <b>Data</b> field that says "CheckedIn".

60
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
This opens a new pop-up window called the <b>Function</b> wizard.

61
00:07:20 --> 00:07:26
Here, let us first empty the <b>Formula</b> text-box at the bottom right.

62
00:07:27 --> 00:07:34
Then click on the <b>Category</b> drop-down and then double-click on ‘IF’.

63
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
Now on the right, we see new controls.

64
00:07:40 --> 00:07:48
Let us click on the <b>Select</b> icon on the right, next to the first text box.

65
00:07:49 --> 00:07:52
Here we will double-click on <b>CheckIn</b>.

66
00:07:53 --> 00:08:00
Next, we will type in <b>Yes</b> within double-quotes in the second text-box.

67
00:08:01 --> 00:08:11
And then type in <b>No</b> in the third text-box. <pause>

68
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
Now we will go to the <b>General</b> tab within the <b>Properties</b> section

69
00:08:18 --> 00:08:23
and click on the button against <b>Formatting</b>, at the bottom.

70
00:08:24 --> 00:08:27
Here, we will click on <b>Text</b> in the <b>Category</b> list

71
00:08:28 --> 00:08:31
and then click on the <b>OK</b> button.

72
00:08:32 --> 00:08:35
And now, we will <b>save</b> the report.

73
00:08:36 --> 00:08:40
Okay, let us <b>run</b> our modified report now.

74
00:08:41 --> 00:08:49
For this, we will click on the <b>Edit</b> menu at the top and then click on the <b>Execute Report</b>.

75
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
And there is our nice report history on the "Books issued to the Library members".

76
00:08:57 --> 00:09:00
Notice the <b>spacing, headers, footers, fonts</b>

77
00:09:01 --> 00:09:05
and the <b>CheckedIn</b> field which says 'Yes' or 'No'.

78
00:09:06 --> 00:09:10
And we are done with modifying our report.

79
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Modifying a Report in LibreOffice Base</b>.

80
00:09:17 --> 00:09:19
To summarize, we learned how to:

81
00:09:20 --> 00:09:25
modify a report by customizing the layout and the look and feel of the report.

00:09:26 --> 00:09:47
