<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
create a <b>Table</b> by-

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:10
a) Creating <b>Views</b> and

5
00:00:11 --> 00:00:12
b) Using the <b>Copy</b> method.

6
00:00:13 --> 00:00:15
Let's go to our <b>Library</b> database.

7
00:00:16 --> 00:00:20
Let us click on the <b>Tables</b> icon on the left panel.

8
00:00:21 --> 00:00:25
On the right panel, we see three ways of creating a table.

9
00:00:26 --> 00:00:29
We will go through the <b>Create View</b> option now.

10
00:00:30 --> 00:00:35
Before that, let us learn about <b>View</b>s. What is a View?

11
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
A <b>view</b> is similar to a <b>table</b> but it does not hold the data.

12
00:00:43 --> 00:00:53
It is defined as a Query Expression, which is simply retrieval of data from tables or other views from the database.

13
00:00:54 --> 00:00:59
So, when viewed, it has columns and rows of data just like a table.

14
00:01:00 --> 00:01:05
<b>View</b>s can be used to allow limited access

15
00:01:06 --> 00:01:12
or hide the structure and names of the underlying table columns and table data.

16
00:01:13 --> 00:01:20
For example, we can create a simple view which will list all the members of the library

17
00:01:21 --> 00:01:26
and we can leave out their phone numbers to maintain confidentiality.

18
00:01:27 --> 00:01:31
Here the underlying table would be <b>Members</b>.

19
00:01:32 --> 00:01:39
Other users of the <b>Library</b> database can be allowed to access this view but not the <b>Members</b> table.

20
00:01:40 --> 00:01:45
In this way, we can only see the names of the members and not their phone numbers.

21
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
Okay, let us go back to the main <b>Base</b> window and create this <b>view</b>.

22
00:01:53 --> 00:01:57
Let us click on <b>Create View</b> on the right panel.

23
00:01:58 --> 00:02:05
We see a new window called the <b>View Design</b> and a pop-up window that says <b>Add tables</b>.

24
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
Let us click on <b>Members</b>

25
00:02:09 --> 00:02:11
and close this pop-up window.

26
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
Now, we are in the <b>View design</b> window.

27
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
And we will double-click on the <b>MemberId</b> and the <b>Name</b> fields.

28
00:02:21 --> 00:02:24
Adding the 'Id' field is always useful

29
00:02:25 --> 00:02:33
because this helps us to join this view with any other related table, for example- the <b>BooksIssued</b> Table.

30
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
We can add functions, criteria and sort it any way we want.

31
00:02:40 --> 00:02:44
But for now, we will sort the member names in ascending order.

32
00:02:45 --> 00:02:53
For this, let us click on the empty <b>cell</b> in the <b>Sort</b> row under the <b>Name</b> column in the bottom section.

33
00:02:54 --> 00:02:57
And then click on <b>‘ascending’</b>.

34
00:02:58 --> 00:03:00
Let us <b>save</b> our first view.

35
00:03:01 --> 00:03:09
Here, let us type a descriptive name for this view- <b>View: Members Name Only</b>.

36
00:03:10 --> 00:03:13
And let us click on the <b>OK</b> button.

37
00:03:14 --> 00:03:21
To see the underlying data, let us click on the <b>Edit</b> menu at the top

38
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
and then click on <b>Run Query</b> at the bottom.

39
00:03:27 --> 00:03:35
And we see a new section at the top that lists all the members of the 'Library' in ascending order.

40
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
Note that we don’t see any phone numbers.

41
00:03:40 --> 00:03:42
And there is our simple <b>view</b>.

42
00:03:43 --> 00:03:47
We can create and design views according to our requirements.

43
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
Before moving on to the next topic, here is an assignment.

44
00:03:53 --> 00:04:00
Create a View of 'Books Issued' to Members and only those books that are not checked-in.

45
00:04:01 --> 00:04:11
Include in the view, the following fields: <b>Book Titles, Member Names, Issue Date</b> and <b>Return Date</b>.

46
00:04:12 --> 00:04:19
Name the view as '<b>View: List of Books not checked in'</b>.

47
00:04:20 --> 00:04:24
Okay, let us learn to create <b>table</b>s by using the <b>copy</b> method.

48
00:04:25 --> 00:04:32
This is an easy way of creating tables, if we know that the table structures are going to be very similar.

49
00:04:33 --> 00:04:38
For this, let us assume that our <b>Library</b> has DVDs and CDs.

50
00:04:39 --> 00:04:43
And we can store this data in a new table called <b>Media</b>.

51
00:04:44 --> 00:04:50
A CD or a DVD can have a title and a publish-year for example.

52
00:04:51 --> 00:04:59
In order to distinguish between an audio and a video, we will introduce a <b>MediaType</b> field.

53
00:05:00 --> 00:05:07
Now, since the <b>Books</b> table has almost similar fields, we can copy-paste the <b>Books</b> table

54
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
and then we can <b>rename</b> the fields and the table name in the process.

55
00:05:14 --> 00:05:15
We’ll see how.

56
00:05:16 --> 00:05:18
Let us go to the main <b>Base</b> window.

57
00:05:19 --> 00:05:22
Here, let us right-click on the <b>Books</b> table

58
00:05:23 --> 00:05:27
and we will see the <b>Copy</b> option. Let us click on it.

59
00:05:28 --> 00:05:30
And then right-click on it.

60
00:05:31 --> 00:05:38
Notice the various options here. There is a <b>Paste</b> and  also there is a <b>Paste Special</b>.

61
00:05:39 --> 00:05:43
We can use <b>copy</b> and <b>paste</b> in a specific format.

62
00:05:44 --> 00:05:50
Possible formats are Formatted text, HTML or a Data Source Table.

63
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
So, we can choose the database table here

64
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
or we can choose <b>Paste</b> from the right-click menu.

65
00:05:59 --> 00:06:02
This opens a wizard and in this window,

66
00:06:03 --> 00:06:10
we will first rename our table by typing in <b>‘Media’</b> against the table name.

67
00:06:11 --> 00:06:15
In the options, we will click on '<b>Definition and data'</b>.

68
00:06:16 --> 00:06:18
Let us click on the <b>Next</b> button.

69
00:06:19 --> 00:06:22
In the next window, we will add the columns.

70
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
Let us choose <b>BookId, title</b> and <b>publish-year</b> for this demonstration.

71
00:06:29 --> 00:06:38
Now, we will select these fields on the left and use the single arrow button to move them to the right side

72
00:06:39 --> 00:06:41
and click on <b>Next</b> button.

73
00:06:42 --> 00:06:45
In the next window, we see our columns.

74
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
Here, we can rename the fields and change their data types.

75
00:06:51 --> 00:06:54
We will rename the <b>BookId</b> to <b>MediaId</b>.

76
00:06:55 --> 00:06:58
And we will click on the <b>Create</b> button.

77
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
In the main <b>Base</b> window, there is our new <b>Media</b> table.

78
00:07:05 --> 00:07:14
Let us now edit the table to add a new field <b>MediaType</b>  which will hold the audio or the video type information.

79
00:07:15 --> 00:07:18
Now, we are in the <b>Table Design</b> window.

80
00:07:19 --> 00:07:23
Here, let us introduce <b>MediaType</b> as the last column.

81
00:07:24 --> 00:07:26
Let us click on the <b>cell</b> below <b>publishyear</b>

82
00:07:27 --> 00:07:35
and enter 'MediaType’ as <b>Field Name</b> and then choose <b>Text</b> or <b>Field Type</b>.

83
00:07:36 --> 00:07:40
Now, let us <b>save</b> the table design and we are done.

84
00:07:41 --> 00:07:47
There, we just created our <b>Media</b> table by using the <b>Copy</b> method.

85
00:07:48 --> 00:07:50
Okay, here is another assignment.

86
00:07:51 --> 00:07:56
Create a table using the ‘Use Wizard to Create table’ method.

87
00:07:57 --> 00:08:03
Here, use the ‘Assets’ sample table and rename it to ‘AssetsCopy’

88
00:08:04 --> 00:08:07
and explore the various options in this method.

89
00:08:08 --> 00:08:13
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Creating Tables in LibreOffice Base</b>.

90
00:08:14 --> 00:08:16
To summarize, we learned how to-

91
00:08:17 --> 00:08:22
Create a Table by
<p>a) Creating Views and
b) Using the Copy method.
