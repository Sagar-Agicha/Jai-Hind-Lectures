<b>Narration</b>

00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:08
create a <b>Subform</b>.

4
00:00:09 --> 00:00:14
For this, let us continue with our familiar <b>Library</b> database example.

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:17
And we will consider the following case:

6
00:00:18 --> 00:00:21
How can we list all the members of the library?

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:30
And for each member, how can we see only those books that have not yet been returned by that member?

8
00:00:31 --> 00:00:35
One way is to create a <b>form</b> listing all the members in the library.

9
00:00:36 --> 00:00:43
And then creating a <b>subform</b> below it, to list those books that have not yet been returned by the member.

10
00:00:44 --> 00:00:48
Once we design this form, we will be able to update the <b>form</b>.

11
00:00:49 --> 00:00:54
For example, when a member returns a book, we can update this information.

12
00:00:55 --> 00:01:00
And, here is a sample screenshot of the form we will design.

13
00:01:01 --> 00:01:05
Notice, it also shows a <b>subform</b> at the bottom.

14
00:01:06 --> 00:01:08
Let's open our <b>Library</b> database.

15
00:01:09 --> 00:01:16
In our previous tutorials, we created the ‘History of Books Issued to Members’ query.

16
00:01:17 --> 00:01:24
Now we will use this <b>query</b> and the <b>Members</b> table as the base for creating our new form.

17
00:01:25 --> 00:01:33
Let us first copy this query by right-clicking on the query name and then let us click on <b>Paste</b>.

18
00:01:34 --> 00:01:41
In the pop-up window for query name, let us type in a new name: ‘Books Not Returned’

19
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
Let us now open the ‘Books Not Returned’ query in <b>edit</b> mode.

20
00:01:48 --> 00:01:57
In the <b>Query Design</b> window, let us add a criterion to show only those books that are not checked-in.

21
00:01:58 --> 00:02:05
For this, let us type ‘equals 0’ in the <b>Criterion</b> column, under <b>CheckedIn</b>.

22
00:02:06 --> 00:02:08
And press <b>Enter</b>.

23
00:02:09 --> 00:02:12
Let us now <b>save</b> the query and close the window.

24
00:02:13 --> 00:02:19
In the main <b>Base</b> window, let us click on the <b>Forms</b> icon on the left panel.

25
00:02:20 --> 00:02:24
And then click on the ‘Use Wizard to create Form’ option.

26
00:02:25 --> 00:02:27
Now we see the familiar <b>Form</b> wizard.

27
00:02:28 --> 00:02:33
Let us go through the 8 steps on the left to create our <b>form</b>.

28
00:02:34 --> 00:02:39
In <b>step 1. field selection</b>, let us choose <b>Table: Members</b>.

29
00:02:40 --> 00:02:45
Then let us move all the fields to the right side.

30
00:02:46 --> 00:02:48
And let us click on the <b>Next</b> button.

31
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
We are in <b>Step 2. Setup a subform.</b>

32
00:02:54 --> 00:02:58
So here, let us check the ‘Add subform’ check-box

33
00:02:59 --> 00:03:06
and click on the option: ‘Subform based on manual selection of fields’.

34
00:03:07 --> 00:03:10
Let us go to <b>Step 3. Add subform fields</b>.

35
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
Here we will call our new <b>query</b> which we designed a few minutes ago.

36
00:03:18 --> 00:03:25
So, let us choose ‘Query: Books Not Returned’ from the <b>Tables or Queries</b> drop-down.

37
00:03:26 --> 00:03:36
And we will move selected fields from the available list to the right side as shown on the screen. <pause>

38
00:03:37 --> 00:03:38
Click on <b>Next</b>.

39
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
<b>Step 4. Get joined fields</b>.

40
00:03:43 --> 00:03:52
Here we will choose the <b>MemberId</b> field from the top two drop-downs, as this is the only relating field.

41
00:03:53 --> 00:03:56
And click on the <b>Next</b> button.

42
00:03:57 --> 00:03:59
<b>Step 5. Arrange Controls</b>.

43
00:04:00 --> 00:04:07
Here, we will choose the third option- <b>Data sheet</b>, for both the <b>form</b> and the <b>subform</b>.

44
00:04:08 --> 00:04:10
And click on the <b>Next</b> button.

45
00:04:11 --> 00:04:14
<b>Step 6. Set data entry</b>.

46
00:04:15 --> 00:04:21
Here, we will leave the options as they are and click on <b>Next</b>.

47
00:04:22 --> 00:04:25
<b>Step 7. Apply Styles</b>.

48
00:04:26 --> 00:04:28
Let us choose Grey as the form background.

49
00:04:29 --> 00:04:31
And go to the final step.

50
00:04:32 --> 00:04:35
<b>Step 8. Set Name</b>.

51
00:04:36 --> 00:04:44
Here, let us give a descriptive name to our form: ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’.

52
00:04:45 --> 00:04:52
And let us click on the <b>Modify form</b> option, as we are going to do some more changes.

53
00:04:53 --> 00:04:55
Now let's click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

54
00:04:56 --> 00:05:03
In the <b>Form Design</b> window, notice that there are two tabular data sheet areas.

55
00:05:04 --> 00:05:10
The one above is called the <b>form</b> and the one below is called the <b>subform</b>.

56
00:05:11 --> 00:05:14
Now, let us add a label above the form.

57
00:05:15 --> 00:05:24
We will click on the <b>Label</b> icon in the <b>Form Controls</b> toolbar at the top and draw it on the form.

58
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
Double clicking on the label, brings up its properties.

59
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
Here we will type ‘Members of the Library’ against label

60
00:05:37 --> 00:05:46
and change the font style to <b>Arial, Bold</b> and <b>Size 12</b>. <pause>

61
00:05:47 --> 00:05:54
Similarly, let us add a second label above the <b>subform</b> as shown on the screen

62
00:05:55 --> 00:05:59
and call it ‘List of Books to be returned by the member’. <pause>

63
00:06:00 --> 00:06:06
Next, let us shorten the form’s length as shown on the screen.

64
00:06:07 --> 00:06:12
And then let us increase the length of the <b>Name</b> field in the <b>form</b>. <pause>

65
00:06:13 --> 00:06:20
Similarly, let us lengthen the <b>Book title</b> field in the <b>subform</b>.

66
00:06:21 --> 00:06:27
Let us change the fonts here to <b>Arial, Bold</b> and <b>Size 8</b>.

67
00:06:28 --> 00:06:36
And change the background color to white for the <b>form</b> and Blue 8 for the <b>subform</b>. <pause>

68
00:06:37 --> 00:06:46
Next, let us hide the <b>MemberId</b> column by right-clicking on it and choosing the <b>Hide</b> column option.

69
00:06:47 --> 00:06:53
Okay, we are done. So, let us <b>save</b> the form design and test it.

70
00:06:54 --> 00:07:02
In the main <b>Base</b> window, let us open the ‘Members Who Need to Return Books’ form by double-clicking on it.

71
00:07:03 --> 00:07:04
There is the <b>form</b>.

72
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
Let us browse through the members by either using the up or down arrow keys,

73
00:07:12 --> 00:07:15
or by simply clicking on the various member names.

74
00:07:16 --> 00:07:22
Notice that the subform below refreshes and shows books to be returned.

75
00:07:23 --> 00:07:26
In the subform, let us choose any record

76
00:07:27 --> 00:07:40
and let us type in ‘12/7/11’ in the actual return date field and check the <b>CheckedIn</b> field

77
00:07:41 --> 00:07:44
and press <b>Enter</b>.

78
00:07:45 --> 00:07:55
Let us now refresh the form by clicking on the <b>Refresh</b> icon in the <b>Form Navigation</b> toolbar at the bottom.

79
00:07:56 --> 00:08:01
Notice that the <b>record</b> we just edited is no longer listed here

80
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
which means the book has been returned or checked-in.

81
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
So, there is our form with a subform.

82
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Subforms in LibreOffice Base</b>.

83
00:08:17 --> 00:08:19
To summarize, we learned how to:

84
00:08:20 --> 00:08:22
create a Subform.
