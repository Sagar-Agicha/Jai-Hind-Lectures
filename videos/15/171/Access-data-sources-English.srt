<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:03
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:04 --> 00:00:07
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

3
00:00:08 --> 00:00:09
Access other Data Sources

4
00:00:10 --> 00:00:14
Register '.odb' databases

5
00:00:15 --> 00:00:16
View Data sources

6
00:00:17 --> 00:00:21
And Use Data Sources in <b>Writer</b>.

7
00:00:22 --> 00:00:27
Let us see how we can access other <b>Data Sources</b> in <b>Base</b>.

8
00:00:28 --> 00:00:36
<b>Libre Office</b> allows other data sources to be accessed apart from <b>Base Databases</b>.

9
00:00:37 --> 00:00:42
It also allows to <b>link</b> them into other <b>Libre Office documents</b>.

10
00:00:43 --> 00:00:52
For example, we can access a <b>spreadsheet</b> or a simple text document from inside LibreOffice Base.

11
00:00:53 --> 00:00:57
And then link them into a <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> document.

12
00:00:58 --> 00:01:05
As an example, let us create an example spreadsheet using <b>LibreOffice Calc.</b>

13
00:01:06 --> 00:01:15
Click on <b>Start Menu >> All Programs</b> and open the <b>LibreOffice Suite menu</b>.

14
00:01:16 --> 00:01:29
Or, if LibreOffice is already open then we can click on <b>File, New</b> and then <b>Spreadsheet</b> to open a new spreadsheet.

15
00:01:30 --> 00:01:45
Now, in the spreadsheet, let us type in some sample data as shown in the image. <pause>

16
00:01:46 --> 00:01:53
And <b>save</b> this spreadsheet as <b>‘LibraryMembers’</b> in a directory location.

17
00:01:54 --> 00:02:01
Now, let us remember the location as we will need to use this file later in our example.

18
00:02:02 --> 00:02:06
And we will close the <b>Calc</b> window.

19
00:02:07 --> 00:02:14
Okay, now let us see how we can access this spreadsheet from 'LibreOffice Base'.

20
00:02:15 --> 00:02:24
To do this, open <b>Base</b> either from <b>Windows</b> <b>Start</b> menu

21
00:02:25 --> 00:02:35
or if LibreOffice is already open then we will click on <b>File, New</b> and then <b>Database</b>.

22
00:02:36 --> 00:02:38
Now, this opens the <b>Database Wizard</b>.

23
00:02:39 --> 00:02:44
Here, we will click on the <b>‘Connect to an existing database’</b>

24
00:02:45 --> 00:02:47
then click on the drop-down.

25
00:02:48 --> 00:02:54
Notice the various database sources in this list that <b>Base</b> can access.

26
00:02:55 --> 00:02:58
And we will click on <b>Spreadsheet</b> here.

27
00:02:59 --> 00:03:01
And the <b>Next</b> button.

28
00:03:02 --> 00:03:09
Now, using the browse button, let us locate the spreadsheet from where we saved it earlier.

29
00:03:10 --> 00:03:15
If there is a password for the spreadsheet, we will need to provide it too.

30
00:03:16 --> 00:03:18
Here we won’t need it.

31
00:03:19 --> 00:03:21
Let us click on the <b>Next</b> button.

32
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Now let us register the spreadsheet as a data source

33
00:03:27 --> 00:03:31
and open it for editing.

34
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
And, click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

35
00:03:36 --> 00:03:43
Now, let us provide a database name here. Let us type in "LibraryMembers".

36
00:03:44 --> 00:03:55
Notice the <b>Save as type</b>: It says <b>ODF Database</b> which is '.odb' in our case.

37
00:03:56 --> 00:04:00
And <b>Save</b> it in the same location as the spreadsheet.

38
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
There we have registered the spreadsheet as a data source in <b>Base</b>.

39
00:04:07 --> 00:04:10
We are in the main Base window now.

40
00:04:11 --> 00:04:15
Here, let us click on the <b>Tables</b> icon in the left panel.

41
00:04:16 --> 00:04:22
Notice the tables ‘Sheet1’, Sheet2, and 'Sheet3'.

42
00:04:23 --> 00:04:30
Let us double-click on <b>Sheet1</b> to open it and here is the data from the spreadsheet.

43
00:04:31 --> 00:04:38
Now, with this method of accessing the Spreadsheet, we cannot make any changes from here.

44
00:04:39 --> 00:04:46
We can only view data or create queries and reports based on the existing data from here.

45
00:04:47 --> 00:04:53
So, changes have to be made directly to the Spreadsheet itself.

46
00:04:54 --> 00:04:58
Registering '.odb' databases.

47
00:04:59 --> 00:05:10
Now, there are other programs such as <b>OpenOffice.org</b> that can produce '.odb' databases.

48
00:05:11 --> 00:05:18
To use these inside LibreOffice Base, we will first need to register them in <b>Base</b>.

49
00:05:19 --> 00:05:27
To register any '.odb' database, we will need to open Base and

50
00:05:28 --> 00:05:35
choose <b>Tools, Options, LibreOffice Base</b> and <b>Databases</b>.

51
00:05:36 --> 00:05:41
Under <b>Registered Databases</b>, click <b>New</b>.

52
00:05:42 --> 00:05:50
Browse to where the database is located and ensure the registered name is correct

53
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
and Click on the <b>OK</b> button.

54
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
Let us see how we can view Data sources in LibreOffice.

55
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06
For this, let us consider the example spreadsheet that we registered in Base.

56
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
Now, we can use it in <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> or <b>Calc</b>.

57
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
For example, let us see how we can view it inside 'LibreOffice Writer'.

58
00:06:19 --> 00:06:23
First, let us open <b>Writer</b> from the 'Base' window.

59
00:06:24 --> 00:06:32
For this, let us click on <b>File, New</b> and then <b>Text Document</b>.

60
00:06:33 --> 00:06:35
Now we are in the <b>Writer</b> window.

61
00:06:36 --> 00:06:45
To view the available data sources, we will click on the <b>View</b> menu at the top and click on <b>Data Sources</b>.

62
00:06:46 --> 00:06:51
Alternately, we can press the <b>F4</b> key.

63
00:06:52 --> 00:07:02
Now we see a list of registered databases at the top left, including "LibraryMembers" which we created just now.

64
00:07:03 --> 00:07:13
To view the database, we will expand it by clicking on the plus symbol on the left of the database name

65
00:07:14 --> 00:07:17
and we will expand Tables.

66
00:07:18 --> 00:07:23
Here are Sheet1, 2 and 3.

67
00:07:24 --> 00:07:27
Let us click on <b>Sheet 1</b>.

68
00:07:28 --> 00:07:35
So, that’s our data at the top right of the Writer window.

69
00:07:36 --> 00:07:42
Now we will see how we can use this data in our example <b>Writer document</b>.

70
00:07:43 --> 00:07:54
Okay, here if we want to use all of the data from the table above then first we will select all the records there.

71
00:07:55 --> 00:08:04
For this, let us click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the first record.

72
00:08:05 --> 00:08:16
Then, while pressing <b>Shift</b> key, we will click on the gray cell to the left of the first column in the last record.

73
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
Notice that all the data gets highlighted.

74
00:08:21 --> 00:08:29
Now we will click, drag and drop this onto the Writer document below.

75
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
Next, we see a pop-up window titled <b>Insert Database columns</b>.

76
00:08:37 --> 00:08:41
So here, we will click on the <b>Table</b> option at the top

77
00:08:42 --> 00:08:51
and then click on the double-arrow button to move all the fields from the left to the right list.

78
00:08:52 --> 00:08:55
Notice the various choices here.

79
00:08:56 --> 00:08:59
For now, we will simply click on the <b>OK</b> button.

80
00:09:00 --> 00:09:04
And here is the entire table of data in the document.

81
00:09:05 --> 00:09:12
Next, let us see how we can insert individual fields.

82
00:09:13 --> 00:09:21
Let us go to the top of the Writer document and press the <b>Enter</b> key twice. Again, go to the top left.

83
00:09:22 --> 00:09:27
Here, let us type in "Member Name" colon.

84
00:09:28 --> 00:09:35
And then click on the <b>Name</b> column in the data sources area at the top right.

85
00:09:36 --> 00:09:42
Now we will click, drag and drop it next to the text we typed.

86
00:09:43 --> 00:09:50
And we will press the <b>Tab</b> key and type in "Phone number" colon.

87
00:09:51 --> 00:09:54
And..... we know what to do, don’t we?

88
00:09:55 --> 00:10:03
We will click and drag the <b>Phone</b> column from the top and drop it next to our text.

89
00:10:04 --> 00:10:12
Then let us highlight the first record by clicking the gray cell to the left of the first record.

90
00:10:13 --> 00:10:18
And then, we will click on the <b>Data to Fields</b> icon.

91
00:10:19 --> 00:10:26
This can be found in the <b>Table Data</b> toolbar at the top, below the <b>Formatting toolbar</b>.

92
00:10:27 --> 00:10:34
Notice that the data in the table above is now in the Writer document.

93
00:10:35 --> 00:10:45
To bring in another record, we just have to highlight a different record and use the <b>Data to Fields</b> icon again.

94
00:10:46 --> 00:10:53
So, there we learnt how to use data sources inside LibreOffice documents.

95
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Accessing other Data Sources in LibreOffice Base</b>.

96
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
To summarize, we learned how to:

97
00:11:05 --> 00:11:06
Access other Data Sources

98
00:11:07 --> 00:11:11
Register .odb databases

99
00:11:12 --> 00:11:13
View Data sources

100
00:11:14 --> 00:11:18
And Use Data Sources in Writer.
