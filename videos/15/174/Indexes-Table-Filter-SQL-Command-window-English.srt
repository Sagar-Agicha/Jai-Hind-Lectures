00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:13
In this tutorial, we will learn the following topics:
<p>Indexes
Table Filter
And the SQL Command window.
</p>

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:15
Let us first learn about <b>Index</b>es.

4
00:00:16 --> 00:00:17
What is an <b>Index</b>?

5
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
An Index is a way to find and sort <b>record</b>s within a <b>database table</b> faster.

6
00:00:26 --> 00:00:35
We can choose one <b>field</b> or multiple fields in a <b>table</b> on which the records need to be indexed.

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:42
The Index stores the location of records based on the chosen field or fields.

8
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
So, to retrieve data, <b>Base</b> can move to the location of the data directly by using the index.

9
00:00:51 --> 00:00:58
And so, it is considerably faster than scanning through all of the records to find the data.

10
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
The <b>primary key</b> of a table is automatically indexed.

11
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
Now, let us create an index in our example <b>Library</b> database.

12
00:01:09 --> 00:01:17
We will create an index on the <b>Title</b> column in the <b>Books</b> table that will speed up searching on book titles.

13
00:01:18 --> 00:01:33
Let us first open our 'Library' database, if not already opened.

14
00:01:34 --> 00:01:38
And open the <b>Books</b> table in <b>Edit</b> mode.

15
00:01:39 --> 00:01:47
In the <b>Table Design</b> window, let us go to the <b>Tools</b> menu and choose <b>Index Design</b>.

16
00:01:48 --> 00:01:56
In the <b>Indexes</b> window, notice that <b>Base</b> already has included the <b>Primary Key</b> as a <b>Unique</b> Index.

17
00:01:57 --> 00:02:04
Let us click on the left most icon, <b>New Index</b>, to create our index.

18
00:02:05 --> 00:02:13
And choose <b>Title</b> in the drop-down list under the <b>Index</b> field on the right.

19
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
We can also choose the <b>Ascending</b> or <b>Descending</b> order here

20
00:02:19 --> 00:02:36
and <b>rename</b> this index to ‘IDX_Title’ by clicking on the third icon on the left and save it using the <b>Save</b> icon next to it.

21
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
So, there is our index on the <b>Title</b> field.

22
00:02:42 --> 00:02:50
In this way we can create, edit, rename or delete indexes for tables using <b>Base</b>.

23
00:02:51 --> 00:02:53
Here is an assignment for you:

24
00:02:54 --> 00:03:02
Create an index on names in the <b>Members</b> table and call it ‘IDX_MemberName’.

25
00:03:03 --> 00:03:06
Next, let us see what a <b>Table Filter</b> is.

26
00:03:07 --> 00:03:14
'Table Filter' feature allows us to hide tables in a <b>Base</b> database from other applications.

27
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
As an example, let us hide all tables except the <b>Books</b> table in the 'Library' database.

28
00:03:22 --> 00:03:26
Now, <b>Table Filter</b> is available under the <b>Tools</b> menu.

29
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
Here, let us check <b>All Views</b> and check the <b>Books</b> table.

30
00:03:33 --> 00:03:38
Meaning, we are marking only the <b>Books</b> table to be visible to other applications.

31
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Now, let us click on the <b>OK</b> button.

32
00:03:43 --> 00:03:49
Next, click on the <b>View</b> menu and then on <b>Refresh Tables</b>.

33
00:03:50 --> 00:03:53
Notice that <b>Books</b> is the only table visible here.

34
00:03:54 --> 00:04:03
Also, when accessing this database from <b>LibreOffice Writer</b> or <b>Calc</b>, we will only see the <b>Books</b> table there.

35
00:04:04 --> 00:04:05
Here is another assignment:

36
00:04:06 --> 00:04:13
Open <b>LibreOffice Writer</b>, access the <b>Library</b> database and check the tables available there.

37
00:04:14 --> 00:04:18
Bring back all the tables to visibility in <b>Base</b>.

38
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
And reopen 'LibreOffice Writer' to check the tables’ availability again.

39
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
Finally, let us learn about the <b>SQL command window</b>.

40
00:04:31 --> 00:04:40
The 'SQL command window' is accessed by choosing <b>SQL</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu.

41
00:04:41 --> 00:04:46
We can use this window to issue <b>SQL statements</b> to the <b>database</b>.

42
00:04:47 --> 00:04:58
Now, we can also use <b>Queries</b> to execute SQL queries but there we are limited to only asking for data from the database.

43
00:04:59 --> 00:05:03
Meaning, we can issue only <b>SELECT</b> statements there.

44
00:05:04 --> 00:05:13
But we cannot <b>execute</b> SQL statements which modify data and table structures or to create new tables there.

45
00:05:14 --> 00:05:23
And the 'SQL command window' helps us to use such <b>data manipulation</b> and <b>data definition</b> statements or language.

46
00:05:24 --> 00:05:30
Examples of <b>Data Manipulation Language</b> or simply <b>DML</b> are:

47
00:05:31 --> 00:05:36
<b>INSERT, UPDATE</b> and <b>DELETE</b> data.

48
00:05:37 --> 00:05:44
And some examples of <b>Data Definition Language</b> or simply <b>DDL</b> are:

49
00:05:45 --> 00:05:50
<b>CREATE TABLE, DROP TABLE</b> and <b>ALTER</b> statements.

50
00:05:51 --> 00:05:54
We will first see a <b>DML</b> example.

51
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
In the <b>Base</b> window, let us open the <b>SQL Command Window</b> from the <b>Tools</b> menu.

52
00:06:02 --> 00:06:11
Let us insert a new record into the <b>Books</b> table by typing in the <b>“Command to execute”</b> text area:

53
00:06:12 --> 00:06:44
<b>INSERT INTO "Books" ( "Title", "Author", "PublishYear", "Publisher", "Price")</b>
<p>VALUES ('The Hobbit', 'J.R.R Tolkien', 2002, 'Oxford', 500);
</p>

54
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
Before clicking on the <b>Execute</b> button, let us look at the command closely now.

55
00:06:52 --> 00:07:02
The <b>INSERT</b> statement lists the <b>table</b> name and the <b>field</b> names and then the <b>Values</b> that need to go into the new record.

56
00:07:03 --> 00:07:10
Notice that the table name and field names are enclosed in double quotes.

57
00:07:11 --> 00:07:21
We know that <b>Base</b> is case sensitive and the double quotes ensure that Base will accept the names as we created.

58
00:07:22 --> 00:07:30
If we don’t use the quotes, Base will automatically convert all names into upper cases.

59
00:07:31 --> 00:07:36
We have to use single quotes to encase the values that are of data type <b>TEXT</b>.

60
00:07:37 --> 00:07:42
NUMERIC fields need not be encased with any quotes.

61
00:07:43 --> 00:07:50
Also, we need not include the <b>BookId</b> field which is an <b>AutoNumber</b> field.

62
00:07:51 --> 00:07:55
<b>Base</b> will take care of auto-generating the number.

63
00:07:56 --> 00:08:04
So, let us execute the SQL. Notice the message <b>‘Command successfully executed’</b>.

64
00:08:05 --> 00:08:11
If there are any errors with the SQL we wrote, Base will point them out.

65
00:08:12 --> 00:08:17
Let us double-click on the <b>Books</b> table and look for the new record we just inserted.

66
00:08:18 --> 00:08:22
There it is, appended in the last row.

67
00:08:23 --> 00:08:26
Next, let us see a <b>DDL</b> example.

68
00:08:27 --> 00:08:35
We will create a new table called <b>Authors</b> with fields <b>AuthorId, Author</b> and <b>Country</b>.

69
00:08:36 --> 00:08:42
In the <b>SQL command window</b>, let us type as shown in the screen

70
00:08:43 --> 00:08:46
and execute it.

71
00:08:47 --> 00:08:53
Let us go back to the <b>Tables</b> list and <b>Refresh</b> the tables from the <b>View</b> menu.

72
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
There is the new <b>Authors</b> table we just created.

73
00:08:59 --> 00:09:05
To know more about <b>DML</b>, visit the website shown on the screen.

74
00:09:06 --> 00:09:12
To know more about <b>DDL</b> visit the Wikipedia website shown on the screen.

75
00:09:13 --> 00:09:15
Here is another assignment for you:

76
00:09:16 --> 00:09:25
Use the <b>UPDATE</b> statement to set the price of the book with <b>BookId</b> as 3, to Rs. 300

77
00:09:26 --> 00:09:29
Delete the book that has the title ‘'The Hobbit'

78
00:09:30 --> 00:09:40
Insert a new record into the <b>Authors</b> table, <b>author name</b> as ‘J.R.R. Tolkien’, and <b>country</b> as‘England’

79
00:09:41 --> 00:09:46
Drop the <b>Authors</b> table from the database by using the <b>DROP</b> statement.

80
00:09:47 --> 00:09:51
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

81
00:09:52 --> 00:10:00
To summarize, we learned the following topics:
<p>Indexes
Table Filter
And the SQL Command window.
