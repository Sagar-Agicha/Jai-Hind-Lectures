<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:00 --> 00:00:02
Welcome to the <b>Spoken tutorial</b> on <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

2
00:00:03 --> 00:00:06
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:

3
00:00:07 --> 00:00:11
Create a <b>report</b>. Select, Label and Sort the report fields.

4
00:00:12 --> 00:00:18
Select report layout and choose report type: static or dynamic.

5
00:00:19 --> 00:00:26
For this, let us consider our familiar <b>Library</b> database example.

6
00:00:27 --> 00:00:35
Here, we have stored information about books and members in this Library database.

7
00:00:36 --> 00:00:41
We also have a <b>table</b> to track the books issued to the members.

8
00:00:42 --> 00:00:47
We learnt how to create <b>form</b>s and queries in the previous tutorials.

9
00:00:48 --> 00:00:55
Before learning how to create a <b>report</b>, let us first learn what a report is?

10
00:00:56 --> 00:01:04
A report is another way to retrieve information from a database, similar to a <b>query</b>.

11
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
We can customize its layout, look and feel so that it is easy to read or print on paper.

12
00:01:14 --> 00:01:20
<b>Report</b>s can be generated from the database’s <b>table</b>s or queries.

13
00:01:21 --> 00:01:31
They can also contain all the fields in the table or in the query or only a selected group of fields.

14
00:01:32 --> 00:01:37
There are two categories of reports - <b>static</b> and <b>dynamic</b>.

15
00:01:38 --> 00:01:41
Whenever a <b>Static report</b> is opened for viewing,

16
00:01:42 --> 00:01:47
it will always display the same data which was there at the time the report was created.

17
00:01:48 --> 00:01:51
This is also known as a snapshot.

18
00:01:52 --> 00:01:59
But a <b>Dynamic report</b> will show current data from the database, whenever it is opened for viewing.

19
00:02:00 --> 00:02:04
Okay, now, let us create a sample report.

20
00:02:05 --> 00:02:07
In the 'Library' database,

21
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
let us click on the <b>Reports</b> icon on the left panel.

22
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
On the right panel, let us click on ‘Use Wizard to create report’.

23
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
This is an easy and fast option to build reports.

24
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
We now see a new window which is also called the <b>Report Builder</b> window

25
00:02:31 --> 00:02:38
and we also see a wizard with 6 steps listed on the left hand side.

26
00:02:39 --> 00:02:46
We will go through the wizard to create a report based on a query we created in the last tutorial-

27
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
'<b>History of books issued to the Library members’</b>.

28
00:02:51 --> 00:02:55
We are in <b>Step 1 - Field Selection</b>.

29
00:02:56 --> 00:03:04
We will specify the source of the report data here: either a table or a query.

30
00:03:05 --> 00:03:13
Let us choose our <b>query: ‘History of Books Issued to Members’</b> from the drop-down list at the top.

31
00:03:14 --> 00:03:20
Now we see a list of available fields from the query on the left hand side.

32
00:03:21 --> 00:03:29
We want all the fields in our report; so we'll simply click on the double-arrow button towards the right.

33
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
Now let us click on the <b>Next</b> button to go to the next step.

34
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
<b>Step 2. Labelling Fields</b>.

35
00:03:39 --> 00:03:49
Let us type the following descriptive labels in the label text-boxes as shown in the image.

36
00:03:50 --> 00:03:54
Okay, let us click on the <b>Next</b> button now.

37
00:03:55 --> 00:03:58
We are in <b>Step 3 - Grouping</b>.

38
00:03:59 --> 00:04:04
This is used whenever we need to group the data by a set of selected fields.

39
00:04:05 --> 00:04:11
For example- in our report, we can group the data by <b>Book title</b>s.

40
00:04:12 --> 00:04:21
If we do that, then in the report we will see a book title and then all the members that it was issued to.

41
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Then we will see the next book title, and so on.

42
00:04:27 --> 00:04:30
For now, let us keep our report simple.

43
00:04:31 --> 00:04:35
So, we will simply click on the <b>Next</b> button.

44
00:04:36 --> 00:04:40
Now, we are in 'Step 4 - Sorting Options'.

45
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
Let us sort the data in chronological order.

46
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
And then sort it by the Book title in ascending order.

47
00:04:52 --> 00:04:57
For this, we will click the <b>Sort by</b> drop-down box

48
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
and then click on <b>Issue Date</b>.

49
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
Then we will click on the second drop-down box

50
00:05:08 --> 00:05:11
and then click on the <b>Book Title</b>.

51
00:05:12 --> 00:05:15
Now, let us click on the <b>Next</b> button.

52
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
Okay. <b>Step 5.- Choose Layout</b>.

53
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
We can customize the look and feel of the report here.

54
00:05:25 --> 00:05:30
Let us click on the <b>‘Columnar, single-column’</b> layout list.

55
00:05:31 --> 00:05:35
Notice that the background <b>Report Builder</b> has refreshed.

56
00:05:36 --> 00:05:42
It shows all the labels on the left and corresponding fields on the right.

57
00:05:43 --> 00:05:47
Let us now click on the <b>‘Columnar, two columns’</b>.

58
00:05:48 --> 00:05:53
Again the window below has refreshed to show a two column layout.

59
00:05:54 --> 00:06:01
In this way, we can choose any of the layouts that <b>Base Wizard</b> provides.

60
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
We can also modify it later as per our requirement.

61
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
For now, we will click on the first item- ‘Tabular’

62
00:06:12 --> 00:06:15
and click on the <b>Next</b> button.

63
00:06:16 --> 00:06:19
Okay, last step  - 'Create Report'.

64
00:06:20 --> 00:06:29
Let us give a descriptive title to our report here: "Books Issued to Members: Report History".

65
00:06:30 --> 00:06:37
Now let us design our report so that the report will always return the latest data from the database.

66
00:06:38 --> 00:06:44
For this, let us click on the <b>Dynamic Report</b> option

67
00:06:45 --> 00:06:51
as we would always like to see the latest data, whenever we open the report for viewing.

68
00:06:52 --> 00:06:58
Okay, we are done with our <b>Report</b>. Let us click on the <b>Create Report now</b> option

69
00:06:59 --> 00:07:04
and finally click on the <b>Finish</b> button.

70
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
Now we see a new window and this is the <b>Report</b> that we built just now.

71
00:07:12 --> 00:07:23
Notice that it has the field labels at the top,  in <b>bold</b> font and the actual data is listed in a tabular fashion.

72
00:07:24 --> 00:07:37
Also notice that it has been sorted by the <b>Issue Date</b> field in ascending order that is, chronologically and then by 'Book Title' in ascending order.

73
00:07:38 --> 00:07:45
Thus we have created our chronological report of books issued to the <b>Library</b> members.

74
00:07:46 --> 00:07:51
In the next tutorial, we will learn how to modify our report.

75
00:07:52 --> 00:07:53
Here is an assignment:

76
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
Create a report of all the books in the library grouped by their <b>Publishers</b>.

77
00:08:01 --> 00:08:06
Both <b>Publishers</b> and <b>Book titles</b> need to be in ascending order.

78
00:08:07 --> 00:08:10
Use the <b>Columnar, Single-column</b> layout.

79
00:08:11 --> 00:08:16
This brings us to the end of this tutorial on <b>Reports</b> in <b>LibreOffice Base</b>.

80
00:08:17 --> 00:08:20
To summarize, we learned how to:

81
00:08:21 --> 00:08:24
Create a Report Select, Label and Sort the report fields

82
00:08:25 --> 00:08:30
Select report layout And * choose report type: static or dynamic.
