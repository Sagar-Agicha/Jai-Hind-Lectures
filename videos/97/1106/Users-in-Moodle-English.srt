00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Users in Moodle</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:16
In this tutorial, we will learn how to:
<p>add a <b>user</b>,
</p><p>edit a <b>user’s profile</b>,
</p><p>upload <b>users</b> in bulk.
</p>

3
00:00:17 --> 00:00:42
This tutorial is recorded using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,
</p><p><b>Apache, MariaDB</b> and <b>PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>
</p><p><b>Moodle 3.3</b>  and 
</p><p><b>Firefox </b>web browser. 
</p><p>You can use any web browser of your choice.
</p>

4
00:00:43 --> 00:00:50
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

5
00:00:51 --> 00:01:04
Learners of this tutorial should have some <b>courses</b> created on their <b>Moodle</b> website.
<p>If not, please refer to the previous<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.
</p>

6
00:01:05 --> 00:01:13
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>Moodle</b> website, using your <b>admin username </b>and <b>password</b>.

7
00:01:14 --> 00:01:18
Now, we will learn how to create a new <b>user</b> in <b>Moodle</b>.

8
00:01:19 --> 00:01:27
In the <b>Navigation block</b>, click on <b>Site Administration</b> and then on the <b>Users </b>tab.

9
00:01:28 --> 00:01:31
Click on<b> Add a new user </b>option.

10
00:01:32 --> 00:01:36
I will enter the <b>username</b> as <b>adminuser2.</b>

11
00:01:37 --> 00:01:44
Scroll down to the <b>New Password</b> field.
<p>Click on the link <b>Click to enter text</b>. 
</p>

12
00:01:45 --> 00:01:50
Please note- the <b>password</b> must follow the rules as shown here.

13
00:01:51 --> 00:01:56
I will enter <b>Spokentutorial1@</b> as my <b>password</b>.

14
00:01:57 --> 00:02:01
Click on the checkbox <b>Force password change</b>.

15
00:02:02 --> 00:02:09
This forces the new <b>user</b> to change his/her <b>password</b> when he/she logs in for the first time.

16
00:02:10 --> 00:02:15
Enter rest of the details as per your preference as shown here.

17
00:02:16 --> 00:02:29
In the <b>Email display</b>, note that I have selected <b>Allow everyone to see my email address</b>.
<p>This is because I am going to make this <b>user </b>as an <b>admin user </b>later. 
</p>

18
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
But this is best avoided for other <b>users </b>like <b>teachers </b>and <b>students</b>.

19
00:02:37 --> 00:02:46
We will leave the <b>City/Town </b>field as blank for now.  We will update this later when we edit this <b>user.</b>

20
00:02:47 --> 00:02:51
Then select <b>country</b> and <b>timezone</b> as shown here.

21
00:02:52 --> 00:02:55
Let all the remaining <b>field</b>s be set to <b>default</b>.

22
00:02:56 --> 00:03:00
Then scroll down and click on <b>Create user</b> button.

23
00:03:01 --> 00:03:09
We now have 2 <b>users</b>. Click on the <b>System Admin2 user </b>which we created just now.

24
00:03:10 --> 00:03:21
We can edit this user’s profile by clicking on the <b>Edit Profile</b> link on the right. Let us enter <b>Mumbai</b> in the <b>City/Town</b> text-box.

25
00:03:22 --> 00:03:32
Then scroll down and click <b>Update profile</b> button. Likewise, we can <b>edit</b> any detail for any user.

26
00:03:33 --> 00:03:42
Look at the 3 <b>icon</b>s to the right of this new <b>user</b>. Hover over them to see what each of them does.

27
00:03:43 --> 00:04:02
The <b>delete</b> icon will delete the <b>user</b>.
<p>Please note: Deleting a user will delete all the <b>user</b> data, including his/ her course registrations, grades etc. 
</p><p>So, this option should be used with extreme caution.
</p>

28
00:04:03 --> 00:04:12
The <b>eye</b> icon will suspend the <b>user</b>. Suspending a <b>user </b>would mean deactivating his/her account.

29
00:04:13 --> 00:04:23
So, the <b>user</b> will no longer be able to login, but his/ her registrations, grades, etc. are all kept intact.

30
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
This is a better thing to do rather than deleting the <b>user</b>.

31
00:04:29 --> 00:04:36
It saves the records for future purposes and you can activate the <b>user </b>back whenever you want to.

32
00:04:37 --> 00:04:42
Next is the <b>gear</b> icon. This will take us to the <b>Edit profile </b>page.

33
00:04:43 --> 00:04:50
Note that <b>delete </b>and <b>suspend </b>icons are not shown next to the <b>Admin User</b>.

34
00:04:51 --> 00:04:58
This is because the <b>main system administrator </b>can never be deleted or deactivated.

35
00:04:59 --> 00:05:04
Now, let us learn to add <b>users </b>in bulk, that is, in one go.

36
00:05:05 --> 00:05:15
For this, we have to upload a file with certain data in a particular format. The accepted file type is <b>CSV</b>.

37
00:05:16 --> 00:05:24
I’ll open the<b> user-details-upoad.csv </b>file which I have already created for demonstration.

38
00:05:25 --> 00:05:31
I’m using <b>LibreOffice Calc</b> which is the <b>spreadsheet</b> component of<b> LibreOffice Suite</b>.

39
00:05:32 --> 00:05:46
This file has the following columns:
<p><b>username</b>,
</p><p><b>password</b>,
</p><p><b>firstname</b>,
</p><p><b>lastname</b>,
</p><p><b>email</b>.
</p><p>These 5 fields are mandatory fields. 
</p>

40
00:05:47 --> 00:05:57
There are some more fields here which are optional:
<p><b>institution</b>,
</p><p><b>department</b>,
</p><p><b>phone1</b>,
</p><p><b>address</b>,
</p><p><b>course1</b>,
</p><p><b>role1</b>.
</p>

41
00:05:58 --> 00:06:10
Note that the field titles have to be exactly as written in this spreadsheet i.e. in lowercase.
<p>Otherwise the upload will throw an error.
</p>

42
00:06:11 --> 00:06:18
If we have only one <b>course </b>in which to enroll the <b>user</b>, we will suffix <b>1 </b>in the fields title.

43
00:06:19 --> 00:06:28
If there are more <b>courses </b>you want to enroll the <b>users </b>to, add more columns with <b>course2, role2,</b> etc.

44
00:06:29 --> 00:06:38
Please note: you should input <b>Course short name</b> in the <b>course1</b> field and <b>Role short name </b>in the <b>role1 </b>field.

45
00:06:39 --> 00:06:46
The <b>Role short name</b> for a student is <b>student</b> and for a teacher is <b>editingteacher</b>.

46
00:06:47 --> 00:07:07
We will have 3 <b>users</b> in this <b>CSV</b> file:
<p><b>System Admin2 </b>user which has already been created manually,
</p><p>one user with only 5 mandatory fields to show that other fields are optional and  one user with all details.
</p>

47
00:07:08 --> 00:07:16
This <b>CSV</b> file is available in the <b>Code files</b> section of this tutorial.  You can download and use it.

48
00:07:17 --> 00:07:24
The <b>Additional Reading Material </b>of this tutorial has more information about the CSV file creation.

49
00:07:25 --> 00:07:28
Now let’s go back to the browser window.

50
00:07:29 --> 00:07:33
Click on <b>Site Administration</b> in the <b>Navigation block</b>.

51
00:07:34 --> 00:07:42
Then click on the <b>Users</b> tab. In the <b>Accounts</b> section, click on <b>Upload Users</b>.

52
00:07:43 --> 00:07:50
Click on <b>Choose a file </b>button. A new pop-up window opens with the title <b>File picker</b>.

53
00:07:51 --> 00:07:58
Click on <b>Upload a file</b> link in the left menu, if the pop-up window is not on that link already.

54
00:07:59 --> 00:08:10
Click on <b>Browse / Choose a file</b> button whichever appears on your <b>interface</b>. Browse to the saved folder and select the <b>CSV</b> file.

55
00:08:11 --> 00:08:14
We will let all the other fields remain as default.

56
00:08:15 --> 00:08:20
At the bottom of the page, click on<b> Upload this file </b>button.

57
00:08:21 --> 00:08:26
The same screen refreshes with the filename now written in the text area.

58
00:08:27 --> 00:08:34
The button at the bottom has now changed to <b>Upload users.</b> Click on this <b>Upload users</b> button.

59
00:08:35 --> 00:08:47
The next page shows a <b>preview</b> of the users that we are uploading.  Verify that the values are correct. Check the <b>Settings</b> section now.

60
00:08:48 --> 00:08:52
The <b>Upload type</b> drop-down has 4 options.

61
00:08:53 --> 00:09:04
These 3 options can be used to update the records of existing users. We will select <b>Add new only, skip existing users</b>.

62
00:09:05 --> 00:09:10
This means that if a <b>username</b> is already existing, it will not be added.

63
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
In the <b>New user password</b> drop-down, select <b>Field required in file</b>.

64
00:09:17 --> 00:09:26
Under <b>Force password change</b>, select <b>All</b>. This will prompt all <b>users</b> to change their <b>passwords</b> when they login for the first time.

65
00:09:27 --> 00:09:31
We will let the other fields in this section remain <b>default</b>.

66
00:09:32 --> 00:09:35
Let us look at the <b>Default values </b>section now.

67
00:09:36 --> 00:09:43
Under <b>Email display</b>, select <b>Allow only other course members to see my email address</b>.

68
00:09:44 --> 00:09:54
You can input the default fields, if they are same for all <b>users</b>. These fields will be used for all uploaded <b>users</b>.

69
00:09:55 --> 00:09:58
I will type <b>Mumbai</b> in <b>City/Town</b>.

70
00:09:59 --> 00:10:06
Next, click on <b>Show more…</b> There are more fields that we can enter data into.

71
00:10:07 --> 00:10:14
But notice that none of them are mandatory. So, I will let these remain blank for now.

72
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
At the bottom of the page, click on<b> Upload users</b> button.

73
00:10:20 --> 00:10:26
Look at the status column of the <b>Upload users results </b>table displayed here.

74
00:10:27 --> 00:10:34
For the 1st <b>user</b>, the status message is:
<p><b>User not added - already registered.</b>
</p>

75
00:10:35 --> 00:10:39
This <b>user</b> already exists in the system, so it was skipped.

76
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
Rest of the <b>users</b> have been added as <b>New users</b>.

77
00:10:45 --> 00:10:48
Look at the status displayed here.

78
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
<b>Weak passwords</b> are the ones that do not follow <b>password</b> rules.

79
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
Though these will be uploaded in the system, it is always preferable to have strong <b>passwords</b>.

80
00:11:01 --> 00:11:07
Click on <b>Continue</b> button. Let us view all the <b>users </b>that we created.

81
00:11:08 --> 00:11:19
Click on <b>Site Administration.</b> Then click on the <b>Users</b> tab. Under the <b>Accounts</b> section, click on <b>Browse list of users.</b>

82
00:11:20 --> 00:11:22
We now have 4 <b>users</b>.

83
00:11:23 --> 00:11:28
With this, we come to the end of the tutorial.
<p>Let us summarize.
</p>

84
00:11:29 --> 00:11:38
In this tutorial, we learnt to:
<p>add a <b>user</b>,
</p><p>edit a <b>user’s profile</b>,
