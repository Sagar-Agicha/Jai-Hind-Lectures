<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Teacher’s dashboard in Moodle.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
In this tutorial, we will learn about a typical <b>Moodle course</b> overview.

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:24
Then we will learn about:
<p>the <b>teachers’ dashboard </b>,
</p><p>how to edit<b> profile </b>and
</p><p>how to edit <b>preferences</b>.
</p>

4
00:00:25 --> 00:00:32
Lastly, we will learn to add some preliminary details pertaining to our <b>course </b>on <b>Moodle.</b>

5
00:00:33 --> 00:00:58
This tutorial is recorded using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,
</p><p><b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,
</p><p><b>Moodle 3.3 </b> and
</p><p><b>Firefox </b>web browser. 
</p><p>You may use any web browser of your choice. 
</p>

6
00:00:59 --> 00:01:06
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

7
00:01:07 --> 00:01:25
This tutorial assumes that your <b>site administrator</b> has set up a <b>Moodle website</b> and assigned you to a new, blank <b>course</b> where you have <b>teacher</b> privileges.
<p>My <b>system administrator </b>has already done the following.
</p>

8
00:01:26 --> 00:01:33
Please note:
<p><b>Teacher</b> role has been assigned to<b> user</b> “Rebecca Raymond” for the<b> course “Calculus”.</b>
</p>

9
00:01:34 --> 00:01:40
Ask your <b>site administrator </b>to refer to the <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

10
00:01:41 --> 00:01:47
And, create a <b>user </b>for you, who has <b>teacher</b> privileges for at least one <b>course</b>.

11
00:01:48 --> 00:01:55
<b>Moodle </b>is one of the most flexible, creative and easy-to-use teaching and learning system.

12
00:01:56 --> 00:02:11
Typically, <b>Moodle</b> can be used by teachers to -
<p>upload their teaching-learning resources, 
</p><p>manage their collection of multimedia e-resources like files, videos etc.,
</p>

13
00:02:12 --> 00:02:21
share web resources and open educational resources,
<p>embed <b>YouTube / Vimeo</b> videos,
</p>

14
00:02:22 --> 00:02:33
administer <b>quizzes</b> and <b>assignments</b>,
<p>encourage the use of collaborative content like <b>Wiki, Glossary</b> etc.
</p>

15
00:02:34 --> 00:02:43
interact and communicate with students synchronously and asynchronously and  track students' learning progress.

16
00:02:44 --> 00:02:49
I have with me, the <b>course overview</b> of my <b>Calculus course</b>.

17
00:02:50 --> 00:03:00
I have-
<p>the <b>topics</b> that will be covered, 
</p><p>number of <b>lectures</b> per week,
</p><p>total number of <b>assignments</b> for the course,
</p>

18
00:03:01 --> 00:03:17
total number of <b>quizzes</b> (weekly or fortnightly),
<p>total number of <b>end of course exams</b>,
</p><p>marks distribution,
</p><p>course materials,
</p><p>book references.
</p>

19
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
I have to structure my <b>course </b>and upload all the materials accordingly on <b>Moodle</b>.

20
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
Switch to the browser and open the <b>Moodle site.</b>

21
00:03:30 --> 00:03:34
A page with a <b>header</b> and <b>Available courses </b>will be displayed.

22
00:03:35 --> 00:03:39
Click on the <b>Login</b> link at the top right corner of the window.

23
00:03:40 --> 00:03:43
I will login as <b>teacher</b> Rebecca Raymond.

24
00:03:44 --> 00:03:56
We are on a page that prompts us to change our <b>password</b>. This is because the <b>Force password change </b>option was activated by the <b>admin </b>earlier.

25
00:03:57 --> 00:04:06
Type the <b>current password </b>followed by the <b>new password</b>. I will type <b>Spokentutorial12 #</b>.

26
00:04:07 --> 00:04:14
Re-type the <b>New password.</b> And then, click on <b>Save changes </b>button at the bottom.

27
00:04:15 --> 00:04:23
A success message appears confirming that the <b>password</b> has been changed. Click on the <b>Continue</b> button.

28
00:04:24 --> 00:04:28
The page that we are in now, is called the <b>dashboard</b>.

29
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
Our <b>dashboard</b> is divided into 3 <b>columns</b>.

30
00:04:34 --> 00:04:46
The one on the left is the <b>Navigation</b> menu. The wider one in the middle, is the main <b>Course overview </b>area with '<b>Timeline'</b> and '<b>Courses'</b> tabs.

31
00:04:47 --> 00:04:50
The one on the right is the <b>Blocks column</b>.

32
00:04:51 --> 00:05:01
<b>Courses</b> tab lists the courses you are enrolled in. Click on the <b>Courses</b> tab in the <b>Course overview </b>area.

33
00:05:02 --> 00:05:16
In the <b>In Progress </b>tab, we see 2 <b>courses</b> here: <b>Calculus</b> and <b>Linear Algebra.</b> These are the <b>courses</b> assigned to <b>teacher</b> Rebecca Raymond by the <b>admin</b>.

34
00:05:17 --> 00:05:29
Future <b>courses </b>assigned to her, will be visible in the <b>Future</b> tab. Likewise, any of her <b>courses</b> that are over, will be seen under the <b>Past </b>tab.

35
00:05:30 --> 00:05:40
Let us now look at the <b>header</b> of the <b>page</b>. On the top left corner, we can see <b>Navigation Drawer </b>or<b> Navigation menu.</b>

36
00:05:41 --> 00:05:47
This gives access to the <b>Calendar, Private Files </b>and<b> My courses </b>links.

37
00:05:48 --> 00:05:57
This is a <b>toggle</b> menu which means it changes its <b>status </b>from <b>open </b>to <b>close </b>and vice-versa, when clicked.

38
00:05:58 --> 00:06:05
At the top right, there are quick access icons for <b>notifications</b> and <b>messages</b>.

39
00:06:06 --> 00:06:17
Clicking on the <b>profile picture</b> at the top right, will enable us to access the <b>user menu</b>. It is also called as the <b>quick access user menu</b>.

40
00:06:18 --> 00:06:27
Click on it. All these <b>menu items</b> are also <b> toggle menus</b>, similar to the one on the left.

41
00:06:28 --> 00:06:35
Click on the <b>Profile</b> option. Every <b>user</b> in <b>Moodle</b> has a <b>profile page</b>.

42
00:06:36 --> 00:06:45
It has links to allow <b>users</b> to edit their <b>profile</b> information,  see the <b>courses</b> they are enrolled in,

43
00:06:46 --> 00:07:00
view their <b>blog </b>or <b>forum</b> <b>posts</b>,  check any <b>reports</b> they have access to and view their <b>access logs</b> that was used to login the last time.

44
00:07:01 --> 00:07:05
Now, let’s click on the <b>Edit Profile</b> link.

45
00:07:06 --> 00:07:23
The <b>Edit Profile</b> page opens up.
<p>This page is divided into 5 sections:
</p><p><b>General</b>,
</p><p><b>User Picture</b>,
</p><p><b>Additional Names</b>,
</p><p><b>Interests</b>,
</p><p><b>Optional</b>.
</p>

46
00:07:24 --> 00:07:29
The <b>General </b>and <b>User picture</b> sections are expanded, by default.

47
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
The <b>‘Expand all’ </b>link on the right, expands all the sections.

48
00:07:36 --> 00:07:41
And clicking on any section name either expands or collapses it.

49
00:07:42 --> 00:07:44
All <b>fields </b>here are editable.

50
00:07:45 --> 00:07:51
You can enter your personal details in <b>General section</b>, as I have done now.

51
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57
As a <b>teacher</b>, I’d like my students to know a little bit about me.

52
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
So, here in the <b>Description</b> field, I will fill out some details.

53
00:08:04 --> 00:08:09
Pause the tutorial and fill out your details as I have done here.

54
00:08:10 --> 00:08:18
You can also add some information in the other fields and sections. You can upload your picture as well.

55
00:08:19 --> 00:08:24
I have added a few more details in <b>General</b> and <b>Optional</b> sections.

56
00:08:25 --> 00:08:29
Then click on <b>Update Profile </b>button and <b>save</b> the page.

57
00:08:30 --> 00:08:39
Now, click on the <b>quick access user menu</b> at the top right again. And, click on the <b>Preferences</b> link.

58
00:08:40 --> 00:08:47
The <b>Preferences</b> page gives <b>users </b>quick access to various settings they may wish to <b>edit</b>.

59
00:08:48 --> 00:08:59
<b>Preferences</b> page, for a <b>teacher’s account </b>, is divided into :
<p><b>User account</b>, <b>Blogs </b>and  <b>Badges. </b>
</p>

60
00:09:00 --> 00:09:05
We have already seen <b>Edit Profile</b> and <b>Change Password</b> earlier.

61
00:09:06 --> 00:09:18
There are some other <b>preferences </b>for
<p><b>Language</b>,
</p><p><b>Forum</b>, 
</p><p><b>Editor</b>, 
</p><p><b>Course</b>,
</p><p><b>Calendar</b>, 
</p><p><b>Message</b>, 
</p><p><b>Notification</b>.
</p>

62
00:09:19 --> 00:09:22
Let’s click on the <b>Calendar preferences</b>.

63
00:09:23 --> 00:09:28
We will set the <b>calendar</b> to display time in <b>24- hour</b> format.

64
00:09:29 --> 00:09:34
Also, we will set the <b>Upcoming events look-ahead</b> to <b>2 weeks</b>.

65
00:09:35 --> 00:09:42
This means, we’ll see notifications for all events happening in the next 2 weeks, on the calendar.

66
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Click on the <b>Save Changes</b> button.

67
00:09:46 --> 00:09:53
We will go through the rest of the <b>preferences</b> when we discuss those features later in this series.

68
00:09:54 --> 00:09:56
Notice the information here.

69
00:09:57 --> 00:10:08
This is the <b>breadcrumb navigation.</b> It’s a visual aid that indicates which page we are on, within the <b>Moodle site’s</b> hierarchy.

70
00:10:09 --> 00:10:14
It helps us to go back to a higher-level page with a single click.

71
00:10:15 --> 00:10:20
Click on the <b>Dashboard </b>link in the <b>breadcrumbs,</b> to go to the <b>dashboard.</b>

72
00:10:21 --> 00:10:27
Now, let us see how to add a topic and brief summary for the <b>Calculus</b> course.

73
00:10:28 --> 00:10:33
Let’s click on the <b>Calculus</b> course in the<b> Navigation menu </b>at the left.

74
00:10:34 --> 00:10:39
On the new page, click on the <b>gear </b>icon at the top right.

75
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
Then click on <b>Turn editing on </b>option.

76
00:10:45 --> 00:10:49
The page now displays more <b>edit</b> options.

77
00:10:50 --> 00:10:54
Click on the <b>pencil</b> icon next to <b>Topic 1</b>.

78
00:10:55 --> 00:11:02
Now, in the text box that appears, type: <b>Basic Calculus</b>. Press <b>Enter.</b>

79
00:11:03 --> 00:11:05
Notice the change of topic name.

80
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
Now, click on the <b>Edit</b> link at the extreme right of that topic.

81
00:11:11 --> 00:11:14
And then click on <b>Edit topic </b>option.

82
00:11:15 --> 00:11:17
This brings us to the <b>Summary</b> page.

83
00:11:18 --> 00:11:26
Here, in the <b>Summary</b> field, we can give a brief summary of the topic. I will type as shown.

84
00:11:27 --> 00:11:31
Scroll down and click on the <b>Save Changes </b>button.

85
00:11:32 --> 00:11:33
Observe the change.

86
00:11:34 --> 00:11:39
This is how we begin to add details of our <b>course </b>in <b>Moodle</b>.

87
00:11:40 --> 00:11:49
We will now logout of <b>Moodle</b>. To do so, click on the <b>user</b> icon at the top right. Now choose <b>Log out </b>option.

88
00:11:50 --> 00:11:55
