7
00:00:52 --> 00:01:02
This tutorial assumes that your <b>site administrator</b> has set up a <b>Moodle website</b>  and registered you as a <b>teacher.</b>

8
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
Learners of this tutorial should have  a <b>teacher login</b> on <b>Moodle</b>

00:01:09 --> 00:01:18
At least one <b>course </b>assigned to them by the <b>administrator</b>

00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

11
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
Switch to the browser and open your <b>moodle site.</b>

12
00:01:31 --> 00:01:40
Login with your <b>teacher username</b> and <b>password</b> details.
<p>I am already logged in as <b>teacher Rebecca Raymond</b>. 
</p>

13
00:01:41 --> 00:01:43
We are in the <b>teacher’s dashboard</b>.

14
00:01:44 --> 00:01:50
In the <b>navigation menu</b> on the left, notice <b>Calculus</b> under <b>My Courses</b>.

15
00:01:51 --> 00:01:58
Please note. All the <b>courses</b> for which you are enrolled as a <b>teacher</b> or <b>student</b> will be listed here.

16
00:01:59 --> 00:02:01
Click on the <b>Calculus course.</b>

17
00:02:02 --> 00:02:08
We updated the <b>course topics</b> and <b>summaries</b> in the preceding tutorials.

18
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
If you didn’t do so, please refer to the assignments of the preceding tutorials.

19
00:02:16 --> 00:02:20
We will now learn about some useful <b>course </b>settings.

20
00:02:21 --> 00:02:25
Click on the <b>gear icon</b> at the top right of the <b>section</b>.

21
00:02:26 --> 00:02:35
Click on <b>Edit Settings</b>. Then click on <b>Expand All</b> at the right, to expand all the <b>sections</b>.

22
00:02:36 --> 00:02:43
The settings seen here, were defined by the <b>administrator</b>, when this <b>course </b>was created.

23
00:02:44 --> 00:02:53
In the <b>General section, </b>we have <b>Course full name.</b>
<p>This is the name displayed at the top of the <b>course page</b>. 
</p>

24
00:02:54 --> 00:03:02
<b>Course short name </b>is the name displayed in the <b>course navigation </b>and in <b>course-</b>related <b>emails</b>.

25
00:03:03 --> 00:03:07
<b>Course category </b>is already set by the <b>admin</b>.

26
00:03:08 --> 00:03:20
We can change <b>Course start date, Course end date </b>and <b>Course ID number</b>, as per our requirements.

27
00:03:21 --> 00:03:30
Under <b>Description section</b>, see the <b>Course Summary </b>textbox.
<p>I will delete the existing content and type the following. 
</p>

28
00:03:31 --> 00:03:36
My students will see this on the front page of my <b>course</b>.

29
00:03:37 --> 00:03:46
Next comes the field <b>Course summary files.</b>
<p>These are the files that will be displayed to the students, along with the <b>Course summary. </b>
</p>

30
00:03:47 --> 00:03:55
By default, only <b>jpg, gif</b> and <b>png file types</b> are allowed as <b>Course summary </b>files.

31
00:03:56 --> 00:04:02
There are 3 ways to upload a file:  Drag and drop the file in the box.

32
00:04:03 --> 00:04:10
Click on the <b>Upload</b> or <b>Add </b>icon at the top left.
<p>Click on the downward arrow. 
</p>

33
00:04:11 --> 00:04:20
If you click on <b>Upload </b>or <b>Add </b>icon or on the downward arrow, the <b>File picker</b> dialog box opens.

34
00:04:21 --> 00:04:25
Click on <b>Upload a file </b>option on the left menu.

35
00:04:26 --> 00:04:33
Click on the <b>Browse </b>or <b>Choose File</b> button.
<p>Then select the desired file from your machine. 
</p>

36
00:04:34 --> 00:04:39
I will select<b> calculus.jpg</b> from my system.

37
00:04:40 --> 00:04:45
You can give it a different name by typing it in the <b>Save as </b>field.

38
00:04:46 --> 00:04:57
Specify the <b>author</b> and <b>license</b> details in the respective fields.
<pre>Lastly, click on <b>Upload this file </b>button at the bottom. 
</pre>

39
00:04:58 --> 00:05:01
So that’s how we can upload <b>Course summary </b>files.

40
00:05:02 --> 00:05:11
Next comes <b>Course format</b>.  <b>Course format</b> refers to the way <b>resources</b> and <b>activities</b> are organized for the students.

41
00:05:12 --> 00:05:25
There are 4 options in <b>Format</b> dropdown -
<p><b>Single Activity Format</b>, <b>Social Format</b> ,  <b>Topics Format </b>and  <b>Weekly Format</b>. 
</p>

42
00:05:26 --> 00:05:32
Our <b>admin</b> has selected <b>Topics format</b>.
<p>We will let it remain as it is. 
</p>

43
00:05:33 --> 00:05:43
Next setting is for <b>Hidden sections</b>.
<p>These are basically <b>topics </b>in a <b>course </b>that can be kept hidden from students. 
</p>

44
00:05:44 --> 00:05:56
This can be useful when there is a certain topic, which is not yet completed by the teacher.
<p>This setting determines how to present the <b>Hidden sections</b> to students. 
</p>

45
00:05:57 --> 00:06:03
Choosing this option will display the content in collapsed form to the students.

46
00:06:04 --> 00:06:08
Choosing this option will hide the content from the students.

47
00:06:09 --> 00:06:12
We will let it remain as default, for now.

48
00:06:13 --> 00:06:18
The next drop-down is <b>Course Layout</b>. Click on it.

49
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
We can choose to show all <b>sections</b> in one page, by selecting this option.

50
00:06:25 --> 00:06:36
Another option here is <b>Show one section per page</b>.
<p>This will split the <b>course </b>over several pages, depending on the number of <b>sections</b>. 
</p>

51
00:06:37 --> 00:06:42
We will let it remain on <b>Show all sections in one page, </b>for now.

52
00:06:43 --> 00:06:45
Next is the <b>Appearance</b> section.

53
00:06:46 --> 00:06:56
Notice the <b>Show gradebook to students</b> option.
<p>Many activities in the <b>course </b>allow teachers to assign grades. 
</p>

54
00:06:57 --> 00:07:09
This option determines whether a student can see those grades.
<p>This option is set to <b>Yes,</b> by default. We will let it remain as is. 
</p>

55
00:07:10 --> 00:07:17
We will change <b>Show activity reports</b> as <b>Yes,</b> if not already selected by default.

56
00:07:18 --> 00:07:26
This ensures that a student can see his/her <b>activity reports </b>from his/her <b>profile page.</b>

57
00:07:27 --> 00:07:33
We can set the maximum size of the files that can be uploaded for this <b>course</b>.

58
00:07:34 --> 00:07:40
Files can be uploaded for <b>additional materials, assignments, </b>etc.

59
00:07:41 --> 00:07:51
Our <b>admin </b>has set this to <b>128MB</b>, which is the maximum file size.
<p>Let us keep the size as it is. 
</p>

60
00:07:52 --> 00:07:57
We will let all the other settings remain at their default values.

61
00:07:58 --> 00:08:05
Scroll down and click on the <b>Save and display </b>button.
<p>We are brought to the <b>Course </b>page. 
</p>

62
00:08:06 --> 00:08:10
Notice the <b>Announcements</b> link above the topic names.

63
00:08:11 --> 00:08:19
This will let the students know about mandatory information, latest news, announcements, etc.

64
00:08:20 --> 00:08:27
Click on the <b>gear</b> icon at the top right of the page and then on <b>Turn Editing On</b>.

65
00:08:28 --> 00:08:34
<b>NOTE</b>: You need to turn the editing on, to make any changes to the <b>course</b>.

66
00:08:35 --> 00:08:43
Now, to the right of <b>Announcements</b>, click on <b>Edit</b> and then <b>Edit Settings.</b>

67
00:08:44 --> 00:08:51
And in <b>Description</b> I will type the following text.
<p><b>“Please check the announcements regularly”.</b>
</p>

68
00:08:52 --> 00:09:00
Check <b>Display description on course page. </b>This will display the description just below the link.

69
00:09:01 --> 00:09:04
Leave all other settings as they are.

70
00:09:05 --> 00:09:14
Scroll down and click on the button <b>Save and return to course.</b>
<p>We come back to the <b>Course </b>page. 
</p>

71
00:09:15 --> 00:09:20
To add more <b>announcements</b>, click on the <b>Announcements</b> title.

72
00:09:21 --> 00:09:30
Now click on <b>Add a new topic</b> button. Type the <b>Subject</b> as <b>Minimum requirements</b>.

73
00:09:31 --> 00:09:42
Type the message as  <b>“This course requires you to submit a minimum of 3 assignments and attempt 5 quizzes to pass”.</b>

74
00:09:43 --> 00:09:58
Notice that the checkbox <b>Discussion subscription</b> is checked and is non-editable.
<p>This is because everyone enrolled in the <b>course</b> is compulsorily subscribed to it. 
</p>

75
00:09:59 --> 00:10:07
Next is <b>Attachments</b>. You can either drag and drop or upload related files here.

76
00:10:08 --> 00:10:17
If you want the announcements to show up at the top of the <b>forum</b>, click on <b>Pinned</b> checkbox.
<p>I will tick it. 
</p>

77
00:10:18 --> 00:10:28
Tick the next checkbox, as well.
<p>This will send a <b>notification</b> to everyone <b>subscribed</b> to this <b>forum</b> immediately. 
</p>

78
00:10:29 --> 00:10:40
Expand the next section<b> Display period.</b>
<p>The settings here determine if this <b>forum post </b>should be visible for a date range. 
</p>

79
00:10:41 --> 00:10:51
By default, these are disabled. It means the <b>posts</b> will always be visible.
<p>We will let the default settings remain. 
</p>

80
00:10:52 --> 00:10:56
Scroll down and click <b>Post to forum</b> button.

81
00:10:57 --> 00:11:07
A success message is displayed. <b>Post authors</b> have 30 min to make any changes to the <b>posts</b>.

82
00:11:08 --> 00:11:12
Let me click on <b>Calculus</b> link in the <b>breadcrumb</b>.

83
00:11:13 --> 00:11:18
Let me now add a page with detailed syllabus to this <b>section</b>.

84
00:11:19 --> 00:11:31
Click on <b>Add an activity or resource</b> link at the bottom right of the <b>General section.</b>
<p>From the list of <b>Resources</b>, choose <b>Page</b>. 
</p>

85
00:11:32 --> 00:11:38
Read the description of this activity that will appear when you make the choice.

86
00:11:39 --> 00:11:46
Then click on the <b>Add</b> button at the bottom.
<p>We are brought to a new page. 
</p>

87
00:11:47 --> 00:11:51
In the <b>Name </b>field, type <b>Detailed syllabus</b>.

88
00:11:52 --> 00:11:58
I will leave the <b>Description </b>textbox blank because the title is self-explanatory.

89
00:11:59 --> 00:12:06
I will enter the detailed syllabus of this <b>Calculus</b> course in the <b>Page Content</b> textbox.

90
00:12:07 --> 00:12:17
This content is available in the <b>Code Files </b>link of this tutorial.
<p>You can download and make use of it while practising. 
</p>

91
00:12:18 --> 00:12:26
Scroll down and click on <b>Save and return to course</b> button.
<p>We come back to the <b>course </b>page again. 
</p>

92
00:12:27 --> 00:12:38
We will now <b>logout</b> of our account. To do so, click on the <b>user icon</b> at the top right.
<p>Now choose <b>Log out</b> option. 
</p>

93
00:12:39 --> 00:12:44
Let me show you how this page will look like to a student.

94
00:12:45 --> 00:12:54
I have a <b>student ID Priya Sinha </b>with me.
<p>This student has also been enrolled in the <b>Calculus</b> course by the <b>admin</b>. 
</p>

95
00:12:55 --> 00:13:03
I have logged in as student <b>Priya Sinha</b>. Now I will click on <b>Calculus</b> on the left.

96
00:13:04 --> 00:13:13
This is how a student will view this page.
<p>Notice that there is no <b>gear icon</b> at the top right of this page. 
</p>

97
00:13:14 --> 00:13:19
This is because students cannot edit any part of the <b>course</b>.

98
00:13:20 --> 00:13:23
We will now log out of the <b>student id.</b>

99
00:13:24 --> 00:13:29
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.
