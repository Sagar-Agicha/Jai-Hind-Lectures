00:01:54 --> 00:01:57
We will now add some additional <b>course material. </b>

15
00:01:58 --> 00:02:08
All <b>course material </b>in <b>Moodle </b>are called <b>Resources</b>.
<p>These are <b>material </b>that a teacher uses to support learning.
</p>

16
00:02:09 --> 00:02:18
<b>Resources</b> could be internal like lecture notes, books or external like <b>Wikipedia links</b>

17
00:02:19 --> 00:02:28
Let’s begin.
<p>Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page and then on <b>Turn Editing On</b>.
</p>

18
00:02:29 --> 00:02:35
Note you need to turn the <b>editing on</b> to make any changes to the <b>course</b>.

19
00:02:36 --> 00:02:43
Click on <b>Add an activity or resource</b> link at the bottom right of the <b>Basic Calculus section. </b>

20
00:02:44 --> 00:02:47
A pop-up opens with a list of <b>resources</b>.

21
00:02:48 --> 00:03:00

Scroll down to see the <b>Page Content</b> box. Copy and paste the text from <b>BasicCalculus-Involutes.odt </b>file.

27
00:03:40 --> 00:03:50
We will be uploading the image at a later stage. This file is available in the <b>Code Files </b>link of this tutorial.

28
00:03:51 --> 00:04:02
Let us now <b>format</b> this text. Click on the down-arrow at the top left of the <b>editor</b> to expand the <b>menu widgets</b>.

29
00:04:03 --> 00:04:06
I will make the headings more prominent, as shown.

00:04:07 --> 00:04:23
The options in the <b>text editor</b> are similar to any other standard<b> text editor</b>. Here we can see options like <b>Bold, Italics, Unordered </b>and<b> Ordered lists.</b>

31
00:04:24 --> 00:04:29
We also see options to <b>hyperlink</b> and <b>unlink</b> a text.

32
00:04:30 --> 00:04:40
There’s an option to add an image, as well. Let us add an image after the text “<b>Figure 1 shows the involute of a circle”.</b>

33
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
Press <b>Enter </b>to make space for the image. Then click on the <b>Image icon</b>.

00:05:42 --> 00:05:57
The next option is to add <b>media</b>. This could be a<b> URL, video</b> or <b>audio</b> file. Again, this can be an <b>external URL</b> or can be uploaded from our machine.

00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
The next option is<b> Manage Files. </b>Let’s click on it.

44
00:06:04 --> 00:06:16
<b>Manage Files</b> option is to have a set of files that you want to store and display.  This could include <b>assignment submissions, resource files,</b> etc.

45
00:06:17 --> 00:06:26
They can be used by any other <b>resource</b> in this <b>course</b>. Notice that the <b>image</b> we uploaded just now, is also present here.

46
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
There are 3 <b>icons</b> on the left of this pop-up box.

47
00:06:32 --> 00:06:36
First is the <b>File picker</b>. Let’s click on it.

48
00:06:37 --> 00:06:51
It has options to see the <b>server files</b>, <b>recent files</b>, etc. <b>Server files</b> are the files which have been used elsewhere in the course and can be reused.

49
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
I will close this for now by clicking on the <b>X icon.</b>

50
00:06:57 --> 00:07:03
Next, we will click on <b>Create Folder icon</b>, which is the second <b>icon</b>.

00:07:10 --> 00:07:14
Then click on the <b>Assignments</b> folder to open it.

53
00:07:15 --> 00:07:19
Let me drag my file inside the <b>Assignments </b>folder.

54
00:07:20 --> 00:07:23
Now, click on the file that that was just uploaded.

55
00:07:24 --> 00:07:33
This pop-up has the option to modify the file name and author. And also to download or delete the file.

56
00:07:34 --> 00:07:40
I don’t wish to change anything. So I will click on the <b>Cancel</b> button at the bottom of the pop-up.

57
00:07:41 --> 00:07:56
Now, pause the tutorial and do this small assignment:
<p>Create a folder <b>Reference Material</b>. 
</p><p>Ensure that the folder is inside the <b>Files</b> folder and not inside the subfolder <b>Assignments</b>.
</p>

58
00:07:57 --> 00:08:04
Upload the 3 files. You will find them in the <b>Code files </b>link of this tutorial.

59
00:08:05 --> 00:08:09
Resume this tutorial after you complete this assignment.

60
00:08:10 --> 00:08:17
Your<b> File manager</b> should now have 2 folders, named <b>Assignments</b> and <b>Reference Material</b>.

61
00:08:18 --> 00:08:25
And another file named <b>involutes-img1.png</b>

62
00:08:26 --> 00:08:32
Close the pop-up window by clicking on the <b>X icon </b>at the top right.

63
00:08:33 --> 00:08:44
The next set of formatting options are
<p><b>Underline, Strikethrough, Subscript </b>and<b> Superscript. </b>
</p>

64
00:08:45 --> 00:08:52
<b>Align</b> and <b>indent </b>options follow these.  These work as in any other <b>text editor</b>.

65
00:08:53 --> 00:08:58
Let’s learn how to use the next option, that is the <b>equation editor</b>.

66
00:08:59 --> 00:09:13
I want to add this sentence with an equation in it.  So I will click on <b>equation editor </b>icon. Then use the <b>equation editor</b> to type the equation.

67
00:09:14 --> 00:09:28
Details about how to use <b>LaTeX</b> to type equations, are in <b>Additional Reading Material</b> link. Click on <b>Save equation </b>button when you have finished.

68
00:09:29 --> 00:09:39
<b>Insert character, insert table</b> and <b>clear formatting</b> options, work as in any other <b>text editor</b>.

69
00:09:40 --> 00:09:50
The next two options are <b>Undo</b> and <b>Redo</b>. These get enabled, only when there is some unsaved text.

70
00:09:51 --> 00:10:04
After this, we have 2 options for <b>accessibility</b>. The first icon is called <b>Accessibility checker. </b>The 2nd one is <b>screen reader helper.</b>

71
00:10:05 --> 00:10:13
Details about <b>accessible websites</b> and these options, are in <b>Additional Reading Material</b> link.

72
00:10:14 --> 00:10:29
The last option is to toggle from the <b>editor view</b> to <b>HTML code </b>view.This can be used to embed images, videos, PPT, interactive content, etc.

73
00:10:30 --> 00:10:38
Click on toggle <b>HTML</b> again. This will bring us back to the normal <b>editor view.</b>

74
00:10:39 --> 00:10:51
I have formatted the text using the <b>bold, italics</b> and<b> list </b>options for this demonstration.Do likewise for your content.

75
00:10:52 --> 00:11:00
When you finish the formatting, scroll down to the bottom and click on <b>Save and display </b>button.

76
00:11:01 --> 00:11:04
We can now <b>logout</b> of <b>Moodle</b>.

77
00:11:05 --> 00:11:10
This is how student <b>Priya Sinha</b> will view this page.

78
00:11:11 --> 00:11:18
