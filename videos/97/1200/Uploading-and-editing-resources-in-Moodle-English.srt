This tutorial assumes that your <b>site administrator</b> has set up a <b>Moodle website</b>
<p>and registered you as a <b>teacher.</b>

Learners of this tutorial should have a <b>teacher login</b> on <b>Moodle</b>
<p>at least one <b>course </b>assigned to them by the <b>administrator</b>
</p>

9
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
And some course material uploaded for their respective <b>course</b>

11
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
To practise this tutorial, you will need to add a student to your course.

12
00:01:28 --> 00:01:34
To know how to add a student, please refer to the tutorial <b>Users in Moodle</b>.

13
00:01:35 --> 00:01:40
I have already added a student, <b>Priya Sinha</b>, to my course.

14
00:01:41 --> 00:01:47
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>moodle site </b>as a <b>teacher.</b>

15
00:01:48 --> 00:01:52
Click on the <b>Calculus course </b>in the left<b> navigation menu.</b>

16
00:01:53 --> 00:01:59
We had added a <b>page resource</b> and a <b>folder resource</b> earlier in the series.

17
00:02:00 --> 00:02:10
We will now add some additional <b>course material. </b>
<p>Click on the <b>gear icon </b>at the top right and then click on<b> Turn Editing On.</b>

<p><b>Open</b> redirects the user to the <b>URL</b> within the same window. 
</p>

32
00:03:55 --> 00:03:59

33
00:04:00 --> 00:04:11

00:04:12 --> 00:04:16
I will select <b>Embed</b> as the <b>Display</b> option.

35
00:04:17 --> 00:04:23
Scroll down to <b>Activity completion section</b> and click on it to expand it.

00:04:24 --> 00:04:31
This <b>section</b> helps the teacher decide if she wants to track the completion of an activity.

37
00:04:32 --> 00:04:40
There are 3 options under <b>Completion tracking</b>.
<p>Depending on the <b>resource</b>, you can decide the tracking mechanism.

A checkmark next to the activity name, indicates when the activity is complete.

00:05:05 --> 00:05:15
Let us now create a <b>book resource</b>. As the name suggests it will have multiple pages, chapters and subchapters

42
00:05:16 --> 00:05:19
It can have multimedia content as well

43
00:05:20 --> 00:05:22
Go back to the <b>browser</b> window now.

44
00:05:23 --> 00:05:29

00:06:29 --> 00:06:33
<b>Text</b> will show previous and next chapters in the navigation.

57

We also have the option of providing a custom <b>title</b> to every chapter navigation.

58

</p>

61
00:06:59 --> 00:07:07

62
00:07:08 --> 00:07:11
Let me click on the <b>Add restriction</b> button.

63

00:07:27 --> 00:07:32

Let us see what happens when we move this subchapter up.
<p>Click on the <b>Up</b> arrow. 
</p>

86
00:10:01 --> 00:10:07
Notice that <b>Introduction</b> now becomes the 2nd chapter instead of a subchapter.

87
00:10:08 --> 00:10:10
Move it back as first chapter again.

88
00:10:11 --> 00:10:20

We now have the below resources for the topic<b> Basic Calculus</b>

93
00:10:40 --> 00:10:44
We can reorder these <b>resources</b> by dragging them.

94
00:10:45 --> 00:10:51
Let me drag <b>Evolutes of Basic curves URL</b> resource, above the other two.

95
00:10:52 --> 00:10:57
There is an <b>Edit</b> link to the right of every <b>resource</b>. Click on it.

96
00:10:58 --> 00:11:08

</p>

97
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
There are 2 other options: <b>Move right </b>and <b>Assign roles</b>.

98
00:11:14 --> 00:11:20
Click on <b>Move right</b>.
<p>This will give a little indentation to the <b>resource</b>. 
</p>

99
00:11:21 --> 00:11:27
This is helpful for visual representation of a <b>resource </b>which is a part of another <b>resource</b>.

100
00:11:28 --> 00:11:33
I will click on <b>Move left </b>to bring this <b>resource</b> back to its original position.

101
00:11:34 --> 00:11:37
We can now logout of <b>Moodle.</b>

102
00:11:38 --> 00:11:40
Let me login as student <b>Priya Sinha</b> now.

103
00:11:41 --> 00:11:45
This is how student <b>Priya Sinha</b> will view this page.

104
00:11:46 --> 00:11:50
Notice that the <b>completion</b> boxes are not ticked the first time.

105
00:11:51 --> 00:11:55
She will need to view this <b>URL</b> to mark this <b>resource</b> as complete.

106
00:11:56 --> 00:12:01
And the <b>book resource</b> is not clickable till the <b>URL resource</b> is marked complete.

107
00:12:02 --> 00:12:06
Let me click on <b>Evolutes of basic curves resource</b>.

108
00:12:07 --> 00:12:16
Now click on <b>Calculus</b> link in the <b>breadcrumb</b>.
<p>The <b>resource</b> is now marked complete and the book is available to the student. 
</p>

109
00:12:17 --> 00:12:22
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.
<p>Let us summarize.
