00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on <b>Forums and Assignments </b>in <b>Moodle.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:20
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
<p>Different types of <b>forums </b>
</p><p>How to add a <b>forum</b> for discussion and
</p><p>How to create <b>Assignments</b>
</p>

3
00:00:21 --> 00:00:43
This tutorial is recorded using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>
</p><p><b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>
</p><p><b>Moodle 3.3 </b> and  <b>Firefox </b>web browser 
</p>

4
00:00:44 --> 00:00:55
You may use any web browser of your choice. However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies.

5
00:00:56 --> 00:01:07
This tutorial assumes that
<p>Your <b>site administrator</b> has registered you as a <b>teacher </b>and 
</p><p>Assigned at least one course to you.
</p>

6
00:01:08 --> 00:01:21
It also assumes that
<p>You have uploaded some course material for your course. If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.
</p>

7
00:01:22 --> 00:01:27
To practise this tutorial, you will need to add a student to your course.

8
00:01:28 --> 00:01:39
To know how to add a student, please refer to the tutorial <b>Users in Moodle</b>.I have already added a student, Priya Sinha, to my course.

9
00:01:40 --> 00:01:46
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>Moodle site </b>using the <b>teacher login.</b>

10
00:01:47 --> 00:01:51
Click on the <b>Calculus course </b>in the left<b> navigation menu.</b>

11
00:01:52 --> 00:01:58
Recall that we had added some <b>course material</b> and <b>announcements </b>earlier.

12
00:01:59 --> 00:02:02
Let us understand what are <b>Forums</b>.

13
00:02:03 --> 00:02:11
<b>Forums</b> can be used by teachers and students for discussions and to exchange ideas

14
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
Whereas <b>Announcements</b> are posted by teachers only

15
00:02:18 --> 00:02:25
<b>Teachers </b>supervise these discussions, to ensure that guidelines are followed by all members

16
00:02:26 --> 00:02:32
Now, we’ll learn how to add a <b>forum. </b>Switch to the <b>Moodle page</b>.

17
00:02:33 --> 00:02:39
Click on the <b>gear icon </b>at the top right and then click on<b> Turn Editing On.</b>

18
00:02:40 --> 00:02:46
Click on <b>Add an activity or resource</b> link at the bottom right of the common section.

19
00:02:47 --> 00:02:52
Scroll down and select <b>Forum</b> in the activity chooser.

20
00:02:53 --> 00:02:58
Click on the <b>Add button </b>at the bottom of the activity chooser.

21
00:02:59 --> 00:03:05
<b>Forum name</b> will display as a link to the<b> forum</b> on the <b>course page</b>.

22
00:03:06 --> 00:03:12
I will type <b>Interesting web resources on evolutes and involutes</b>.

23
00:03:13 --> 00:03:22
<b>Description</b> can be used to explain the purpose of the<b> forum</b> to the students. I will type the text as shown here.

24
00:03:23 --> 00:03:29
Click on <b>Display description on course page </b>checkbox below this text area.

25
00:03:30 --> 00:03:39
Next option is <b>Forum type</b>. By default, <b>Standard forum for general use</b> is selected.

26
00:03:40 --> 00:03:49
There are 5 <b>forum types </b>in <b>Moodle</b>. Click on the <b>Help icon</b> next to the drop-down to read about the <b>types</b> of <b>Forums</b>.

27
00:03:50 --> 00:04:00
Depending on your requirement, you can choose the <b>Forum type</b>. I will select <b>Standard forum displayed in a blog-like format</b>.

28
00:04:01 --> 00:04:08
Scroll down and click on <b>Save and display</b> button at the bottom of the page.

29
00:04:09 --> 00:04:16
We are brought to a new page. Here, click on <b>Add a new topic</b> button.

30
00:04:17 --> 00:04:28
I will type the <b>Subject</b> and <b>Message</b> as shown here. Rest of the options are similar to that of an announcement.

31
00:04:29 --> 00:04:35
Scroll down and click on <b>Post to forum</b> button at the bottom of the page.

32
00:04:36 --> 00:04:38
A success message is displayed.

33
00:04:39 --> 00:04:53
Notice the message says that the author of the <b>post</b> can edit the <b>post</b> within 30 mins. This however, holds true only for <b>non-teacher profiles</b>.

34
00:04:54 --> 00:05:02
The teacher who is the moderator and creator of the <b>course</b>, can edit and delete any<b> post</b> at any time.

35
00:05:03 --> 00:05:14
I will now login as student <b>Priya Sinha</b>. We can then see how a student views this <b>forum</b>.

36
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
Click on the <b>forum</b> name in the list of <b>resources</b> to see the discussions.

37
00:05:21 --> 00:05:34
As a student, I can either <b>Add a new topic</b> or <b>Discuss this topic</b>. Let me click on <b>Discuss this topic</b> link at the bottom right.

38
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
Then click on the <b>Reply</b> link. I will add a comment, as shown.

39
00:05:42 --> 00:05:52
Scroll down and click on <b>Post to forum</b> button at the bottom of the page. You can see the comment has been added to the end of this thread.

40
00:05:53 --> 00:06:00
Let me login as teacher <b>Rebecca</b> again, to see the <b>comment</b> posted by the student.

41
00:06:01 --> 00:06:11
Click on the name of the <b>forum</b>. Notice here, we can see <b>1 reply so far</b> for this discussion topic.

42
00:06:12 --> 00:06:20
The actual message can be seen after clicking on <b>Discuss this topic</b> link, at the bottom right.

43
00:06:21 --> 00:06:33
There is another option here named as <b>Split</b>. If the teacher feels the reply deserves a separate discussion, she can split the discussion.

44
00:06:34 --> 00:06:48
Splitting a discussion creates a new discussion. The new discussion and later posts in that thread, will be moved to a new discussion thread. I will let it remain as it is.

45
00:06:49 --> 00:06:52
Let us go back to the <b>Calculus</b> course.

46
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
Next we will learn how to create an <b>assignment</b>.

47
00:06:58 --> 00:07:19
<b>Assignment </b>in<b> Moodle</b>:
<p>can be submitted online, which saves paper 
</p><p>enables students to include media files like audio, video, powerpoint presentations, etc. And
</p><p>helps teachers to be unbiased by choosing to <b>grade</b> the students blindly
</p>

48
00:07:20 --> 00:07:22
Let’s go back to the browser.

49
00:07:23 --> 00:07:27
<b>Turn editing on</b> to add more resources

50
00:07:28 --> 00:07:34
Click on <b>Add an activity or resource</b> link at the bottom right of the <b>Basic Calculus</b> section.

51
00:07:35 --> 00:07:41
Double-click on <b>Assignment</b> from the list to add a new <b>assignment</b>.

52
00:07:42 --> 00:07:46
Let me provide a name for the <b>assignment</b>, as shown here.

53
00:07:47 --> 00:07:54
Next, describe the <b>assignment</b> in detail and mention what the students are expected to submit.

54
00:07:55 --> 00:08:01
This is a simple formatted <b>text editor</b>, you can include <b>tables, images,</b> etc.

55
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
You can copy the text I have typed here from the <b>AssignmentResource.odt</b> file.

56
00:08:07 --> 00:08:12
It is available in the <b>Code files </b>link of this tutorial.

57
00:08:13 --> 00:08:16
Scroll down to see the <b>Availability </b>section.

58
00:08:17 --> 00:08:27
Next, we will specify the date and time from which submissions can be made. Ensure <b>Enable</b> boxes  checked.

59
00:08:28 --> 00:08:38
You can also use the calendar icon to select the date. I will set this as <b>25 Nov 2018.</b>

60
00:08:39 --> 00:08:45
Then I will set <b>Due date </b>as <b>15 Dec 2018</b>.

61
00:08:46 --> 00:08:53
Click on the <b>Help icon</b> to find out the meaning of <b>Cut-off date</b> and <b>Remind me to grade by </b>date.

62
00:08:54 --> 00:09:01
Set them if required or disable if not required. I will disable them.

63
00:09:02 --> 00:09:16
Uncheck <b>Always show description </b>checkbox.If this field is enabled,Then students can see the description of the <b>assignment</b> even before the <b>Allow submissions from date</b>.

64
00:09:17 --> 00:09:29
Next is the <b>Submission types</b> section. Decide if you want to allow students to submit online text or want them to only upload files.

65
00:09:30 --> 00:09:41
I will check both <b>Online text</b> and <b>File submissions</b>. Depending on your requirement, you can choose either one or both the options.

66
00:09:42 --> 00:09:47
I will enable the <b>Word limit</b> and enter <b>1000</b> here.

67
00:09:48 --> 00:10:02
You can specify the number of files each student can upload, as well. Additionally, we can specify the maximum file size and the <b>types</b> of files we will accept.

68
00:10:03 --> 00:10:13
Please note:
<p>This will override the maximum file size set by the <b>admin</b>, which is <b>128 MB,</b> in our case.
</p>

69
00:10:14 --> 00:10:25
Click on the <b>Help icon</b> next to <b>Accepted file types.</b> Here we can read about the <b>file types </b>this <b>field</b> accepts.

70
00:10:26 --> 00:10:33
I will type <b>.pdf,.docx,.doc </b>here.

71
00:10:34 --> 00:10:45
Review the <b>fields</b> under <b>Feedback types</b> and <b>Submission settings</b>.  You can enable or disable them based on your requirements.

72
00:10:46 --> 00:10:49
I have chosen the settings as shown.

73
00:10:50 --> 00:10:56
Now, scroll down and click on the <b>Grade</b> section to expand it.

74
00:10:57 --> 00:11:03
The <b>maximum grade</b> by default is 100. We will let this remain as it is.

75
00:11:04 --> 00:11:12
Then I will enter the <b>Grade to pass</b> as 40. And set <b>Blind marking</b> to <b>Yes</b>.

76
00:11:13 --> 00:11:25
This will hide the identity of the student from the evaluators. So now, as a teacher, I won’t know which student has submitted which <b>assignment</b>.

77
00:11:26 --> 00:11:30
Which invariably, helps me to be unbiased while grading.

78
00:11:31 --> 00:11:39
Please note that
<p><b>Blind marking</b> setting cannot be changed for this assignment  after any submission is made.
</p>

79
00:11:40 --> 00:11:45
There are various other settings for the <b>assignment</b> which you can explore on your own.

80
00:11:46 --> 00:11:51
Now, scroll down and click on <b>Save and display</b> button.

81
00:11:52 --> 00:12:02
You can see some statistics about the <b>assignment</b> here.
<p>And a link to <b>View all submissions</b> and <b>Grade</b>.
</p>

82
00:12:03 --> 00:12:08
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

83
00:12:09 --> 00:12:19
