In this tutorial, we will learn about:  <b>Question bank </b>in <b>Moodle </b>

3
00:00:12 --> 00:00:18
<b>Categories </b>of <b>questions</b> and How to add questions to the <b>question bank</b>.

4
00:00:19 --> 00:00:25
This tutorial is recorded using:  <b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>

5
00:00:26 --> 00:00:33
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>

6
00:00:34 --> 00:00:43

<p>You may use any web browser of your choice. 
</p>

7
00:00:44 --> 00:00:51
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies.

8
00:00:52 --> 00:01:02
This tutorial assumes that your <b>site administrator</b> has registered you as a <b>teacher</b>
<p>And assigned at least one course to you. 
</p>

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:08
It also assumes that You have uploaded some course material for your course.

10
00:01:09 --> 00:01:15
If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:23
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>Moodle site </b>as a <b>teacher.</b>

12
00:01:24 --> 00:01:39
I have provided a text file with all the text that is used in this tutorial, in the <b>Code files</b> link.
<p>Please download the file named “<b>Mytextfile.txt</b>” and open it on your machine. 
</p>

13
00:01:40 --> 00:01:44
Click on the <b>Calculus course </b>in the left<b> navigation menu.</b>

14
00:01:45 --> 00:01:48
We will begin by learning about <b>Question banks</b>.

15
00:01:49 --> 00:01:54
A <b>Question bank</b> is a collection of questions, mostly organized by topics

16
00:01:55 --> 00:02:00
Questions in the <b>Question bank</b> can be reused in multiple <b>quizzes</b>.

17
00:02:01 --> 00:02:08
This helps to create different <b>quizzes</b> for each academic year or for different batches.

18
00:02:09 --> 00:02:10
Switch back to the browser.

19
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
Click on the <b>gear icon </b>at the top right and then click on the<b> More… </b>link at the end.

20
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
We are brought to the <b>Course Administration </b>page.

21
00:02:22 --> 00:02:26
Scroll down and locate the section named <b>Question bank</b>.

22
00:02:27 --> 00:02:29
Click on the <b>Categories</b> link in this section.

23
00:02:30 --> 00:02:33
Look at the <b>Add category </b>section.

24
00:02:34 --> 00:02:36
Click on the <b>Parent category</b> dropdown.

25
00:02:37 --> 00:02:41
Here <b>Top</b> is the top level category for this course.

26
00:02:42 --> 00:02:48
Select <b>Default for Calculus, </b>if it is not already selected by default.

27
00:02:49 --> 00:02:53
In the <b>Name</b> field, type <b>Basic Calculus</b>.

28
00:02:54 --> 00:03:03
Then click on <b>Add Category</b> button at the bottom of the page.
<p>Likewise, we can add more <b>categories</b>. 
</p>

29
00:03:04 --> 00:03:10
Create a hierarchy of <b>categories</b> for the <b>Calculus course,</b> like I have done here.

30
00:03:11 --> 00:03:16
Go to the questions creation page by clicking on the <b>Questions</b> tab.

31
00:03:17 --> 00:03:21
Click on <b>Create a new question</b> button at the bottom.

32
00:03:22 --> 00:03:24
A pop-up window opens.

33
00:03:25 --> 00:03:28
Select the <b>type</b> of question that you wish to add.

34
00:03:29 --> 00:03:34
Detailed description about the<b> question type</b> is seen on the right side.

35
00:03:35 --> 00:03:38
I will select <b>Multiple choice</b>.

36
00:03:39 --> 00:03:42
Click on <b>Add</b> button at the bottom of the pop-up.

37
00:03:43 --> 00:03:50
Now, select the <b>category</b> for which you want to add the question.
<p>I will choose <b>Evolutes.</b>
</p>

38
00:03:51 --> 00:03:56
In the <b>Question name</b> field, type <b>MCQ with single correct answer</b>.

39
00:03:57 --> 00:04:06
Type the following question in the <b>Question text</b> area.
<p>You can copy-paste the text from the <b>Mytextfile.txt </b>file. 
</p>

40
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
The <b>Default Mark</b> is set to 1 and I will let it be as 1.

41
00:04:12 --> 00:04:22
Next option is <b>General feedback</b>. The text here is shown to the student after he/she has submitted the quiz.

42
00:04:23 --> 00:04:33
This can be used to show the detailed solution of the question, also.
<p>Type or copy-paste the text as I have done here. 
</p>

43
00:04:34 --> 00:04:38
Now, click on the <b>One or multiple answers</b> dropdown.

44
00:04:39 --> 00:04:45
Here we see 2 options- <b>Multiple answers allowed</b>
<p><b>One answer only</b>
</p>

45
00:04:46 --> 00:04:48
I’ll show you how both options work.

46
00:04:49 --> 00:04:52
Let me first choose <b>One answer only.</b>

47
00:04:53 --> 00:05:05
The <b>Shuffle the choices</b> checkbox is checked, by default.
<p>This ensures that the answer choices within the question, are shuffled for each <b>quiz attempt</b>. 
</p>

48
00:05:06 --> 00:05:09
Scroll down to see the <b>Answers</b> section.

49
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
Notice that every option here is associated with a <b>grade</b> and <b>feedback</b>.

50
00:05:17 --> 00:05:19
Type <b>Choice 1</b> as shown here.

51
00:05:20 --> 00:05:24
Now for this question, <b>Choice 1</b> is the correct answer.

52
00:05:25 --> 00:05:29
Therefore I will select <b>100%</b> in the <b>Grade</b>.

53
00:05:30 --> 00:05:37
In the <b>Grade</b> dropdown, we can also allot partial marks or negative marks to every <b>choice</b>.

54
00:05:38 --> 00:05:42
You can explore these later when you are more proficient with <b>Moodle</b>.

55
00:05:43 --> 00:05:52
Feedback for students who choose this answer, can be written in the <b>Feedback</b> text area.
<p>I will type “<b>Correct</b>”. 
</p>

56
00:05:53 --> 00:06:00
Fill the rest of the <b>choices</b> and <b>grades</b>, as I have done here.

57
00:06:01 --> 00:06:07
Now scroll down and click on <b>Multiple Tries</b> section to expand it.

58
00:06:08 --> 00:06:17
Notice here - the <b>Penalty for each incorrect try </b>field<b> </b>is set by default, to 33.33%

59
00:06:18 --> 00:06:23
This means a student will be penalised for every wrong answer.

60
00:06:24 --> 00:06:30
You can leave it as it is or change it to any of the other percentage options shown here.

61
00:06:31 --> 00:06:38
I will select <b>0%, </b>as I don’t wish to penalise my students for wrong answers.

62
00:06:39 --> 00:06:45
Then scroll down and click on <b>Save changes</b> button at the bottom of the page.

63
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
We can see that our question has been added to the <b>Question Bank</b>.

64
00:06:51 --> 00:06:56
Notice that there are 4 icons next to the question title of the question.

65
00:06:57 --> 00:07:05
These are to <b>edit, duplicate, preview</b> and <b>delete</b> the question.

66
00:07:06 --> 00:07:12
Click on <b>Preview</b> icon to see how the question will appear in the <b>quiz</b>.

67
00:07:13 --> 00:07:18
The selected question and its options opens in a pop-up window.

68
00:07:19 --> 00:07:28
Click on <b>Fill in correct responses</b> button.
<p>This helps you to verify the questions, the choices and the correct answer. 
</p>

69
00:07:29 --> 00:07:31
Click on <b>Submit and finish </b>button.

70
00:07:32 --> 00:07:37
This will show the feedback that the student will see, after answering the question.

71
00:07:38 --> 00:07:43
Whenever you add a new question, always preview it to cross check.

72
00:07:44 --> 00:07:48
Click on <b>Close preview</b> button to close this pop-up window.

73
00:07:49 --> 00:07:53
Let us now create an <b>MCQ</b> which has more than one correct answer.

74
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
Following the previous steps, I have created another <b>MCQ</b>.
<p>Please do so likewise. 
</p>

75
00:08:01 --> 00:08:09
In <b>One or multiple answers </b>dropdown, this time I will select <b>Multiple answers allowed.</b>

76
00:08:10 --> 00:08:19
Enter the <b>choices 1 </b>and <b>2</b> and their respective <b>grades</b> as shown.
<p>Here I have selected <b>50% grade</b> for both. 
</p>

77
00:08:20 --> 00:08:25
A student who marks only 1 correct answer gets <b>0.5 marks</b>.

78
00:08:26 --> 00:08:31
And the student who marks both correct answers gets <b>1 mark.</b>

79
00:08:32 --> 00:08:37
Enter the <b>choices 3</b> and <b>4</b> and their respective <b>grades</b> as shown.

80
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
And I will keep <b>Penalty for each incorrect try </b>field as 0%.

81
00:08:44 --> 00:08:48
Then scroll down and click on <b>Save changes</b> button.

82
00:08:49 --> 00:08:52
Next, let’s add a <b>Short answer </b>question.

83
00:08:53 --> 00:08:59
The student will be expected to type in a word or phrase, in response to the question.

84
00:09:00 --> 00:09:07
Click on <b>Create a new question </b>button and double-click on<b> Short answer</b> option.

85
00:09:08 --> 00:09:10
Create the question as shown.

86
00:09:11 --> 00:09:17
In <b>Case sensitivity</b> dropdown, select <b>No, case is unimportant.</b>

87
00:09:18 --> 00:09:23
The correct answer to this question is <b>“same logarithmic spiral”</b>

88
00:09:24 --> 00:09:34
I am willing to give full marks to a student if whose answer is either:
<p><b>“same spiral” </b>or  <b>“same logarithmic</b> <b>spiral”</b>
</p>

89
00:09:35 --> 00:09:42
However, if the student writes<b> “logarithmic spiral”</b> as the answer, I will give half mark.

90
00:09:43 --> 00:09:45
Scroll down to the answers section.

91
00:09:46 --> 00:09:51
Fill in <b>Answer 1</b> and <b>2</b> and their respective <b>grades</b> as shown.

92
00:09:52 --> 00:10:01
Notice the<b> asterix</b> in <b>Answer 1</b> text.
<p><b>Asterix </b>can be used as a <b>wildcard</b> to match any character. 
</p>

93
00:10:02 --> 00:10:14
So for eg: A student writes <b>The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is the same logarithmic spiral.</b>
<p>This answer will be awarded full marks. 
</p>

94
00:10:15 --> 00:10:19
Fill in <b>Answer 3</b> and its respective <b>grade</b> as shown.

95
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Notice there is no <b>asterix</b> before the answer text.

96
00:10:24 --> 00:10:36
So for example: A student writes <b>The evolute of a logarithmic spiral is not the same logarithmic spiral.</b>
<p>This answer will be not be awarded any marks. 
</p>

97
00:10:37 --> 00:10:42
Fill in <b>Answer 4</b> and its respective<b> grade</b> as shown.

98
00:10:43 --> 00:10:47
Notice that I have awarded only <b>50%</b> marks to this answer.

99
00:10:48 --> 00:10:56
In the feedback textarea, type <b>“You need to specify that it’s the same spiral and not any spiral.”</b>

100
00:10:57 --> 00:11:01
This explanation will be shown to the student as feedback.

101
00:11:02 --> 00:11:08
Once again, I will keep <b>Penalty for each incorrect try </b>field as 0%.

102
00:11:09 --> 00:11:13
Then scroll down and click on <b>Save changes</b> button.

103
00:11:14 --> 00:11:17
Let us now add a <b>Numerical</b> question.

104
00:11:18 --> 00:11:25
Click on <b>Create a new question</b> button and double click on <b>Numerical</b> option.

105
00:11:26 --> 00:11:28
Create the question as shown.

106
00:11:29 --> 00:11:40
The answer to this question is<b> 5mm</b>.
<p>However, I am okay with the student answering anywhere between 4.5mm and 5.5mm. 
</p>

107
00:11:41 --> 00:11:44
The error margin here is 0.5.

108
00:11:45 --> 00:11:47
Scroll down to the <b>Answers</b> section.

109
00:11:48 --> 00:11:52
Enter the <b>Answers, Error</b> and <b>grades</b> as shown.

110
00:11:53 --> 00:11:59
Expand the <b>Unit handling </b>section.
<p>There are 3 options in the <b>Unit handling</b> dropdown. 
</p>

111
00:12:00 --> 00:12:06
I will select the option - <b>The unit must be given, and will be graded</b>.

112
00:12:07 --> 00:12:15
The <b>Unit penalty field</b>, by default, shows <b>0.1</b>
<p>I will make it <b>0.5</b>. 
</p>

113
00:12:16 --> 00:12:22
So the student will get half of the marks if they write the answer without mentioning the <b>unit</b>.

114
00:12:23 --> 00:12:30
In the <b>Units are input using</b> dropdown, I will select <b>the text input element</b> option.

115
00:12:31 --> 00:12:36
This means the student has to type the <b>unit</b> along with the answer.

116
00:12:37 --> 00:12:39
Expand the <b>Units</b> section.

117
00:12:40 --> 00:12:49
Write Unit as <b>mm</b> and multiplier is <b>1</b>. This means the answer choices are in <b>mm</b>.

118
00:12:50 --> 00:12:56
Once again, I will keep <b>Penalty for each incorrect try </b>field as 0%.

119
00:12:57 --> 00:13:01
And then scroll down and click on <b>Save changes</b> button.

120
00:13:02 --> 00:13:07
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.
<p>Let us summarize. 
</p>

121
00:13:08 --> 00:13:13
