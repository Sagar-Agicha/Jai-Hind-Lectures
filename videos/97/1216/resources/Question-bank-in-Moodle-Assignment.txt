Question Type: True/False
Category: Evolutes
Question Name: True-False question
Question text: The evolute of the involute of a circle is the circle itself.
Default mark: 1
General Feedback: In the involute of a circle, the normal NM at any point N is tangent to the circle at the point of contact M. M is the centre of curvature at the point N. Hence, the evolute of the involute is the circle itself.
Correct Answer: True

Question text: 
Steps are given to determine the centre of curvature at a given point on an Ellipse. Arrange the steps. Let P be the given point on the conic and F and F1 are the foci.
i. Produce F1G to H so that GH = VF. Join H with F.
ii. Then O is the required centre of curvature.
iii. Draw a line GO parallel to HF and intersecting the axis at O.
iv. Draw a line F1G inclines to the axis and equal to VF1.

Default mark: 1
General feedback: First we just took the arbitrary line passing through one of the foci and then extended up to the length from that focus to opposite vertex and then extended further up to length of distance between vertex and respective focus. Drawing parallel lines on to the focus gave us O.

Question text: 
Steps are given to determine the centre of curvature at a given point on a hyperbola. Arrange the steps. Let P be the given point on the conic, V is vertex and F and F1 are the foci.
i. Draw a line GO parallel to HF and cutting the axis at O.
ii. Draw a line F1G inclined to the axis and equal to FV1.
iii. Then O is the centre of curvature at the vertex V.
iv. On F1G, mark a point H such that HG = VF. Join H with F.

Default mark: 1

Question text: Helix angle can be expressed as tan(theta) =
Default mark: 1
General feedback: The helix is seen as a straight line and is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle having base equal to the circumference of the circle and the vertical side equal to the pitch of the helix. The angle 0 (theta) which it makes with the base, is called the helix angle.
Case sensitivity: No, case is unimportant

Answer 1: Pitch/circumference of the circle
Grade: 100%

Answer 2: circumference of the circle/pitch
Grade: None

Answer 3: Pitch/mean diameter
Grade: None

Answer 4: outer diameter/inner diameter
