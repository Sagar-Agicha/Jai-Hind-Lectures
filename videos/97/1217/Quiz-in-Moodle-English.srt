</p><p>And assigned at least one course to you.

It also assumes that you have added some questions to the <b>question bank</b> for your <b>course</b>.
<p>If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.
</p>

7
00:01:12 --> 00:01:17
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>Moodle site.</b>

8
00:01:18 --> 00:01:21
Click on the <b>Calculus course </b>in the left<b> navigation menu.</b>

9
00:01:22 --> 00:01:28
Click on the <b>gear icon</b> at the top right, and then on <b>Turn Editing On</b>.

10
00:01:29 --> 00:01:36
Click on <b>Add an activity or resource</b> link at the bottom right of the <b>Basic Calculus</b> section.

11
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
Scroll down and select <b>Quiz</b> in the <b>activity chooser</b>.

12
00:01:42 --> 00:01:46
Click on the <b>Add </b>button<b> </b>at the bottom of the <b>activity chooser</b>.

13
00:01:47 --> 00:01:53
In the <b>Name </b>field, I will type <b>Quiz 1 - Evolutes and involutes.</b>

14
00:01:54 --> 00:01:59
Then in the <b>Description field</b>, I will type the text as shown.

15
00:02:00 --> 00:02:08
Check the <b>Display description on course page</b> checkbox. After this, we’ll expand the <b>Timing</b> section.

16
00:02:09 --> 00:02:16
And enable the check-boxes for <b>Open the quiz</b>, <b>Close the quiz</b> and <b>Time limit</b>.

17
00:02:17 --> 00:02:24
This will open and close the quiz on the given dates and for a specific time duration.

18
00:02:25 --> 00:02:31
Set the dates and time as per your requirements.  I have set them as displayed here.

19
00:02:32 --> 00:02:36
Then I will set the time limit as 10 mins.

20
00:02:37 --> 00:02:46
The <b>When time expires field</b> has 3 options. Choose the one which is appropriate for your <b>quiz</b>.

21
00:02:47 --> 00:03:00
I will choose <b>Open attempts are submitted automatically</b>. So even if the student fails to submit, the <b>quiz</b> will be automatically submitted after 10 mins.

22
00:03:01 --> 00:03:04
Now, let’s expand the <b>Grade</b> section.

23
00:03:05 --> 00:03:17
In the <b>Grade to pass field</b>, I will type <b>2</b> as the <b>passing grade</b>. This means the student will need a minimum of 2 marks to pass this <b>quiz</b>.

24
00:03:18 --> 00:03:31
In the <b>Attempts allowed</b> field, I will select <b>1</b>. If we choose a higher number, the student will be able to attempt the same quiz, that many times.

25
00:03:32 --> 00:03:36
Notice that <b>Grading method</b> dropdown is disabled.

26
00:03:37 --> 00:03:46
This is enabled only when more than one attempts are allowed.  The teacher can then select which attempt to grade.

27
00:03:47 --> 00:03:55
Now expand the <b>Layout </b>section. Here, there are options to specify the layout of the <b>quiz</b>.

28
00:03:56 --> 00:04:03
By default, in the <b>New page field</b> dropdown, <b>Every question </b>option is selected.

29
00:04:04 --> 00:04:08
Click on the <b>New page field</b> dropdown to see all the options.

30
00:04:09 --> 00:04:16
I will select <b>Every 2 questions </b>option. You can select any option as per your choice.

31
00:04:17 --> 00:04:21
Next we will expand the <b>Question behaviour</b> section.

32
00:04:22 --> 00:04:26
Choose <b>Yes</b> for <b>Shuffle within questions </b>dropdown.

33
00:04:27 --> 00:04:32
On doing so, all the options within each question, will be shuffled.

34
00:04:33 --> 00:04:39
So, each student will see a different arrangement of questions and options in their <b>quiz</b>.

35
00:04:40 --> 00:04:46
Click on the help icon for <b>How questions behave </b>dropdown and read the details.

36
00:04:47 --> 00:04:56
I will let <b>Deferred feedback</b> be the option here. So my students will see the feedback only after their attempt is submitted.

37
00:04:57 --> 00:05:01
Next, click on the <b>Overall feedback </b>section to expand it.

38
00:05:02 --> 00:05:09
<b>Overall feedback</b> is the text shown to the student after the quiz is submitted and auto-graded.

39
00:05:10 --> 00:05:16
Teachers can give different <b>feedback</b> depending on the <b>grade</b> obtained by the student.

40
00:05:17 --> 00:05:24
I will type<b> Excellent performance</b> as the <b>feedback</b> for <b>grade boundary 100%.</b>

41
00:05:25 --> 00:05:32
Students who score between <b>50%</b> and <b>100%</b> will see the "<b>Excellent performance</b>" message.

42
00:05:33 --> 00:05:39
And <b>You need to work harder</b> as the <b>feedback</b> for <b>grade boundary 50%.</b>

43
00:05:40 --> 00:05:48
Students who score between <b>0% </b>and <b>49.99%</b> will see "<b>You need to work harder</b>".

44
00:05:49 --> 00:05:53
Now, scroll down and click on <b>Activity completion</b> section.

45
00:05:54 --> 00:06:04
Click on the dropdown for <b>Completion Tracking field</b>. Select the option <b>Show activity as complete when conditions are met.</b>

46
00:06:05 --> 00:06:12
Check the checkboxes for <b>Require grade </b>and <b>Require passing grade</b>.

47
00:06:13 --> 00:06:19
Lastly, click on <b>Save and display</b> button at the bottom of the page.

48
00:06:20 --> 00:06:30
We are brought to a new page with the <b>quiz</b> title that we gave. Read and verify that all the details given earlier are displayed here.

49
00:06:31 --> 00:06:37
Here you can see a message displayed prominently - <b>No questions have been added yet</b>.

50
00:06:38 --> 00:06:43
To add questions to the <b>quiz</b>, click on the <b>Edit quiz </b>button.

51
00:06:44 --> 00:06:49
On the top right, type the <b>Maximum grade </b>as 4.

52
00:06:50 --> 00:07:02
The pencil icon on the left of the <b>quiz</b> section allows us to edit the heading of this <b>quiz</b>.
<p>It is useful when the <b>quiz</b> has multiple sections.
</p>

53
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
I will write <b>Section 1</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

54
00:07:08 --> 00:07:19
Then check the <b>Shuffle</b> checkbox on the right. This ensures that the questions are shuffled every time the <b>quiz</b> is attempted.

55
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
Click on the <b>Add</b> link below <b>Shuffle</b> checkbox.

56
00:07:25 --> 00:07:33
There are 3 options here:
<p><b>a new question</b>
</p><p><b>from question bank</b>
</p><p><b>a random question</b>
</p>

57
00:07:34 --> 00:07:43
As the name suggests, <b>a new question</b> link enables us to add a new question. So, I will not select this option.

58
00:07:44 --> 00:07:47
Click on <b>from question bank</b> link.

59
00:07:48 --> 00:07:57
A pop-up window opens. This option is used when you want a fixed set of questions for every student.

60
00:07:58 --> 00:08:03
The <b>category</b> selected will be the default <b>category</b> for that <b>course</b>.

61
00:08:04 --> 00:08:11
The option <b>Also show questions from subcategories</b> is selected by default.

62
00:08:12 --> 00:08:18
<b>Also show old questions</b> shows the questions that have been used in previous <b>quizzes</b>.

63
00:08:19 --> 00:08:31
You can select the questions you want to add, as I am doing now. And then click on <b>Add selected questions to the quiz</b> button at the bottom.

64
00:08:32 --> 00:08:39
However, I will not do that.I will close this window by clicking on the<b> X </b>icon at the top right.

65
00:08:40 --> 00:08:50
Click on the <b>Add</b> link below <b>Shuffle</b> once again. Click on<b> a random question</b> link.
<p>Another pop-up window open.
</p>

66
00:08:51 --> 00:09:02
With this option, each student will see a different set of questions. And it will be difficult for them to discuss the answers while attempting the <b>quiz</b>.

67
00:09:03 --> 00:09:10
Under <b>Random question from an existing category</b>, I will select the <b>category</b> as <b>Evolutes</b>.

68
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
In <b>Number of random questions</b>, I will select 2.

00:09:16 --> 00:09:22
Then click on <b>Add random question</b> button below this dropdown.

75
00:09:55 --> 00:10:06
Notice that the <b>quiz</b> is automatically divided into 2 pages. This is because we had given this option earlier in the <b>Quiz Settings</b>.

76
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
Click on the add link below the 2nd question, at the extreme right.
