00:00:01 --> 00:00:07
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Enroll students and communicate in Moodle.</b>

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:17
In this tutorial, we will learn how to: Enroll students who were uploaded via a <b>csv file </b>to a <b>course</b>,

3
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
Make <b>groups</b> in <b>courses</b> and
<p>Send <b>messages</b> and <b>notes</b> to the students. 
</p>

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:32
This tutorial is recorded using: <b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,

5
00:00:33 --> 00:00:40
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,

6
00:00:41 --> 00:00:50
<b>Moodle 3.3 </b> and  <b>Firefox </b>web browser.
<p>You may use any web browser of your choice. 
</p>

7
00:00:51 --> 00:00:59
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

8
00:01:00 --> 00:01:10
This tutorial assumes that:
<p>your <b>site administrator</b> has registered you as a <b>teacher</b>
</p><p>and assigned at least one <b>course</b> to you.
</p>

9
00:01:11 --> 00:01:18
It also assumes that you have added some <b>course material, assignment</b>s and <b>quizz</b>es for your <b>course</b>.

10
00:01:19 --> 00:01:25
If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

11
00:01:26 --> 00:01:35
Before we begin, please ask your <b>Moodle site administrator</b> to add 5 or 6 <b>users to your Moodle site.</b>

12
00:01:36 --> 00:01:46
You will be adding these new <b>users</b> to your <b>course </b>later. So ensure that new <b>users</b> are added to your Moodle site.

13
00:01:47 --> 00:01:58
Teachers in <b>Moodle</b> cannot add new <b>users</b> to the system.
<p>They can only enroll <b>users</b> that are already added by the <b>site administrator</b>.
</p>

14
00:01:59 --> 00:02:05
Switch to the browser and login to your <b>Moodle site </b>as a <b>teacher.</b>

15
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
Click on the <b>Calculus course </b>in the left<b> navigation menu.</b>

16
00:02:11 --> 00:02:17
Click on the <b>gear icon</b> at the top right and then on <b>More...</b>.

17
00:02:18 --> 00:02:21
We are on the <b>Course Administration</b> page.

18
00:02:22 --> 00:02:24
Click on the <b>Users</b> tab.

19
00:02:25 --> 00:02:29
Click on <b>Enrolled users</b> link within the <b>Users</b> section.

20
00:02:30 --> 00:02:37
There are 2 <b>users</b> enrolled to this <b>course</b> - <b>Rebecca Raymond</b> and <b>Priya Sinha</b>.

21
00:02:38 --> 00:02:43
<b>Rebecca Raymond </b>has <b>teacher role</b> and <b>Priya Sinha</b> has <b>student role.</b>

22
00:02:44 --> 00:02:48
Now, click on the <b>Enrol users</b> button at the bottom right.

23
00:02:49 --> 00:02:54
This list has students that I want to enroll to my <b>Calculus course.</b>

24
00:02:55 --> 00:02:59
Select <b>Student</b> in the <b>Assign Roles</b> dropdown.

25
00:03:00 --> 00:03:05
Then click on the <b>Enrol</b> button next to the <b>users</b> that you want to enroll.

26
00:03:06 --> 00:03:10
I will enroll a few students in my<b> course</b> right now.

27
00:03:11 --> 00:03:17
Once done, click on the <b>Finish enrolling users</b> button at the bottom right.

28
00:03:18 --> 00:03:24
We can see the number of enrolled <b>users</b> for the <b>Calculus course</b> at the top of the page.

29
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
Next, let us learn how to make some <b>groups</b> in the <b>course</b>.

30
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
These <b>groups</b> will help us assign students for <b>group activities</b>.

31
00:03:36 --> 00:03:41
I will make 2 groups - <b>Explorers</b> and <b>Creators.</b>

32
00:03:42 --> 00:03:47
Click on <b>Calculus</b> in the <b>breadcrumb</b> to go back to the <b>course page</b>.

33
00:03:48 --> 00:03:51
And go to the <b>Course Administrator</b> page again.

34
00:03:52 --> 00:03:55
Click on <b>Groups</b> link in the <b>Users</b> tab.

00:04:05 --> 00:04:07
There are no other mandatory fields.

38
00:04:08 --> 00:04:11
Scroll down and click on <b>Save changes </b>button.

39
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
Notice that <b>Explorers</b> can now be seen on the left side, in the list of <b>groups</b>.

40
00:04:19 --> 00:04:29
The number zero next to it indicates that there are no <b>users</b> in that <b>group </b>yet.
<p>Select <b>Explorers</b>, if not already selected.
</p>

41
00:04:30 --> 00:04:35
Then click on <b>Add/remove users</b> button at the bottom right.

42
00:04:36 --> 00:04:41
I will select <b>Susmitha</b> and <b>Sai</b> from the list of students.

43
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
And then click on <b>Add</b> button in the middle of the 2 columns.

44
00:04:48 --> 00:04:53
On the left, observe the list of<b> users</b> in the <b>group Explorers</b>.

45
00:04:54 --> 00:04:59
On the right, observe the list of all other students enrolled in this <b>course</b>.

46
00:05:00 --> 00:05:05
They can be added to this<b> group</b> as and when required, by the teacher.

47
00:05:06 --> 00:05:14
<b>Add</b> and <b>Remove</b> buttons between the 2 lists, get enabled when we select <b>users</b> from the lists.

48
00:05:15 --> 00:05:20
Click on <b>Back to groups </b>button at the bottom of the page.

49
00:05:21 --> 00:05:27
Pause this tutorial and do this small assignment. Add a new <b>group</b> called <b>Creators</b>

50
00:05:28 --> 00:05:34
Assign 2 new <b>users</b> to that <b>group</b>
<p>Resume the tutorial when done.
</p>

51
00:05:35 --> 00:05:39
Now you should be able to see a screen like this.

52
00:05:40 --> 00:05:47
Notice the columns<b> Roles, Groups </b>and<b> Enrolment Methods</b> have icons.

53
00:05:48 --> 00:05:54
Move your mouse over each of the <b>icons</b> to understand their functions.

54
00:05:55 --> 00:06:01
Note that: An enrolled student can belong to more than one <b>group</b> as well.

55
00:06:02 --> 00:06:06
Let us now see how we can send a <b>message</b> to the students.

56
00:06:07 --> 00:06:11
Click on <b>Participants</b> link in the left navigation bar.

57
00:06:12 --> 00:06:18
This will show the list of all <b>enrolled users</b> with their assigned <b>roles</b> in the <b>course</b>.

58
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
By default, <b>Moodle Participants</b> page displays only 20 students.

59
00:06:25 --> 00:06:37
You will need to click on <b>Show all</b> if you have more than 20 students to see all the students.
<p>The link is not visible right now because I don’t have more than 20 students.
</p>

60
00:06:38 --> 00:06:45
There are some filters seen above the list of <b>users</b>. Use them to help select the right set of <b>users</b>.

61
00:06:46 --> 00:06:50
I will select <b>Student</b> in the <b>Current role</b> dropdown.

62
00:06:51 --> 00:06:57
This will filter the list to show only the <b>users</b> who have <b>student role </b>assigned to them.

63
00:06:58 --> 00:07:03
Click on <b>Select all</b> button at the bottom of the page to select all the students.

64
00:07:04 --> 00:07:10
Then select <b>Send a message</b> in <b>With selected users</b> dropdown.

65
00:07:11 --> 00:07:15
This will send a common <b>message</b> to all the selected <b>students</b>.

66
00:07:16 --> 00:07:21
Pause the tutorial and type the <b>message</b> as shown here in the <b>Message body</b>.

67
00:07:22 --> 00:07:28
Then at the bottom, click on the <b>Preview</b> button, to preview the <b>message</b> before sending.

68
00:07:29 --> 00:07:34
You can also update the <b>message</b>, if required, by clicking on the <b>Update</b> button.

69
00:07:35 --> 00:07:39
To send the <b>message</b>, click on the <b>Send message</b> button.

70
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
You will see a confirmation message and a link to go to back to the <b>participants lists</b>.

71
00:07:46 --> 00:07:49
Click on<b> Back to participants list</b>.

72
00:07:50 --> 00:07:59
Click on <b>With selected users</b> dropdown. Notice the options to send <b>notes</b>; both private and common.

73
00:08:00 --> 00:08:02
Let’s select any 2 <b>users.</b>

74
00:08:03 --> 00:08:08
Select <b>Add a new note </b>from the <b>With selected users</b> dropdown.

75
00:08:09 --> 00:08:14
In the <b>Content</b> text area of one <b>user</b>, I will type the <b>note</b> as shown.

76
00:08:15 --> 00:08:21
In the <b>Content</b> text area next to another <b>user</b>, I will type the <b>note</b> as shown here.

77
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
Look at the <b>Context</b> dropdown to the right.

78
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
The <b>Context </b>of a<b> note</b> determines which <b>users</b> can see the <b>note</b>.

79
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
A <b>personal note</b> will be seen only by the teacher and the student being sent to.

80
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
A <b>course note</b> will be visible to the other teachers of this <b>course</b>.

81
00:08:44 --> 00:08:49
A <b>site note</b> will be visible to all teachers in all <b>courses</b>.

82
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
Most institutions have their own rules regarding communication between teachers and students.

83
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
You can decide the <b>Context</b> based on these guidelines.

84
00:09:02 --> 00:09:05
I will let the <b>Context</b> be <b>course</b>.

85
00:09:06 --> 00:09:09
Click on <b>Save changes</b> button when done.

86
00:09:10 --> 00:09:15
