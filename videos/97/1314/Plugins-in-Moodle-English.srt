00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the Spoken Tutorial on<b> Installing plugins in Moodle</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
In this tutorial, we will learn about:  <b>Plugins </b>and How to install a <b>plugin</b> in <b>Moodle</b>

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:22
To record this tutorial, I will be using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>
</p>

4
00:00:23 --> 00:00:30
<b>Apache, MariaDB</b> and <b>PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>

5
00:00:31 --> 00:00:32
<b>Moodle 3.3</b>

6
00:00:33 --> 00:00:39
<b>Firefox web browser</b> and  Working <b>Internet</b> connection

7
00:00:40 --> 00:00:43
You can use any <b>web browser</b> of your choice.

8
00:00:44 --> 00:00:51
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

9
00:00:52 --> 00:00:58
Learners of this tutorial should have some <b>courses</b> and <b>users</b> in their <b>Moodle</b> website.

10
00:00:59 --> 00:01:05
If not, please refer to the relevant<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

11
00:01:06 --> 00:01:14
What are <b>plugins</b>?
<p><b>Plugins</b> are add-on tools that add special features to an existing software 
</p>

12
00:01:15 --> 00:01:21
<b>Moodle</b> has several useful <b>plugins</b> for teachers as well as site administrators

13
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
These are available in the <b>plugins</b> directory

14
00:01:26 --> 00:01:35
Open the <b>browser</b> and type <a class="external free" href="https://moodle.org/plugins" rel="nofollow">https://moodle.org/plugins</a>

15
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
The page has filters based on <b>Purpose </b>and<b> Plugin Type</b>.

16
00:01:41 --> 00:01:45
There is also a <b>search</b> box, for custom search.

17
00:01:46 --> 00:01:52
There are some numbers displayed at the top right.
<p>The text below indicates what they are. 
</p>

18
00:01:53 --> 00:01:58
In this tutorial, we will learn how to install the <b>attendance plugin.</b>

19
00:01:59 --> 00:02:04
Type <b>attendance</b> in the <b>search</b> box and click on the <b>Search</b> button.

20
00:02:05 --> 00:02:12
We see that there are multiple <b>plugins</b> having this keyword, either in their title or description.

21
00:02:13 --> 00:02:21
Click on <b>Attendance plugin</b>.
<p>The description reads “<b>A plugin that allows an attendance log to be kept.</b>” 
</p>

22
00:02:22 --> 00:02:29
To verify that you have clicked on the same <b>plugin</b> that I mentioned, check the title on the new page.

23
00:02:30 --> 00:02:35
It should say <b>Activities colon Attendance </b>as the title.

24
00:02:36 --> 00:02:41
This <b>plugin</b> allows a teacher to keep an <b>attendance log</b> in <b>Moodle</b>.

25
00:02:42 --> 00:02:49
Before installing any new <b>plugin</b>, ensure that it is available for the <b>Moodle</b> version you are using.

26
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
To verify, click on the <b>Versions</b> link to see the versions that it supports.

27
00:02:56 --> 00:03:02
Scroll down to see that it is available for our version of <b>Moodle 3.3</b>

28
00:03:03 --> 00:03:05
Go back to the <b>Description</b> link.

29
00:03:06 --> 00:03:11
Read the description to understand whether the <b>plugin</b> fulfills your purpose.

30
00:03:12 --> 00:03:19
It also mentions prerequisites for using the <b>plugin</b> and the usage instructions, if any.

31
00:03:20 --> 00:03:26
We can see that it is being used on a number of websites and has many fans.

32
00:03:27 --> 00:03:32
This authenticates that the <b>plugin</b> is useful and easy to use.

33
00:03:33 --> 00:03:39
You may also want to scroll down and see the questions others have asked related to this <b>plugin</b>.

34
00:03:40 --> 00:03:45
When you are convinced you want to install the <b>plugin</b>, go back to the <b>Versions</b> link.

35
00:03:46 --> 00:03:48
Click on the <b>Download</b> button.

36
00:03:49 --> 00:03:54
Save the file on your local system. I have already saved it in my system.

37
00:03:55 --> 00:04:01
Open a new tab and login to your <b>Moodle</b> website as <b>site administrator</b>.

38
00:04:02 --> 00:04:05
Make sure that the <b>XAMPP service</b> is running.

39
00:04:06 --> 00:04:08
We are now in the <b>admin dashboard</b>.

40
00:04:09 --> 00:04:12
Click on <b>Site Administration</b> on the left side.

41
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
Then click on <b>Plugins</b> tab and then on <b>Install plugins </b>link.

42
00:04:20 --> 00:04:28
There are 2 ways to install a <b>plugin</b> - through <b>Moodle plugins directory</b> and through a <b>zip</b> upload.

43
00:04:29 --> 00:04:32
We will cover the second method only.

44
00:04:33 --> 00:04:40
The first method requires us to have an account on <b>moodle.org</b>, hence we are skipping it.

45
00:04:41 --> 00:04:45
Click on <b>Choose a file</b> button next to <b>Zip package</b>.

46
00:04:46 --> 00:04:51
Click on <b>Upload a file</b> link on the left, if it is not already selected.

47
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
Click on <b>Browse</b> button and browse to the location where you have saved the <b>plugin</b> file.

48
00:04:59 --> 00:05:02
Select the zip file which we downloaded earlier.

49
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
Then click on <b>Upload this file</b> button at the bottom of this window.

50
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
Now click on <b>Install plugin from the ZIP file</b> button at the bottom.

51
00:05:14 --> 00:05:17
You may encounter an error in this page.

52
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23
The error message says <b>Validating mod_attendance ... Error</b>

53
00:05:24 --> 00:05:26
Click on the <b>Cancel</b> link.

54
00:05:27 --> 00:05:32
This is an indicator for us to give<b> write permission</b> to this directory.

55
00:05:33 --> 00:05:38
So open the <b>terminal</b> by pressing <b>Control + Alt + T</b> keys.

56
00:05:39 --> 00:05:55
Type <b>sudo space chmod space 777 space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash moodle slash mod slash </b>

57
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
Enter the <b>administrative password</b> if prompted and press <b>Enter</b>.

58
00:06:02 --> 00:06:08
Let us go back to the browser and repeat the process.

59
00:06:09 --> 00:06:16
This time we get the validation successful message. Click on the <b>Continue</b> button.

60
00:06:17 --> 00:06:24
Please note that this additional step is required only if you get the above error screen.

61
00:06:25 --> 00:06:30
Now, the <b>plugin</b> is downloaded and validated for this version of <b>Moodle</b>.

62
00:06:31 --> 00:06:35
Next, we will get a page with the title <b>Plugins check</b>.

63
00:06:36 --> 00:06:42
Notice the <b>status</b> information in green here, which says <b>To be installed.</b>

64
00:06:43 --> 00:06:46
Click on <b>Upgrade Moodle database now</b> button.

65
00:06:47 --> 00:06:52
This step may take some time. Please do not refresh or close the <b>browser </b>window.

66
00:06:53 --> 00:06:57
When you see the success message, then click on the <b>Continue</b> button.

67
00:06:58 --> 00:07:01
We are now in the <b>New settings</b> page.

68
00:07:02 --> 00:07:09
Go through all the <b>settings</b> to see if you need to change any of them.
<p>I do not wish to make any changes. 
</p>

69
00:07:10 --> 00:07:15
After checking, click on the <b>Save Changes</b> button at the bottom of the page.

70
00:07:16 --> 00:07:20
You may see some warning messages which you can ignore for the time being.

71
00:07:21 --> 00:07:28
To see if the <b>plugin </b>is installed successfully, click on <b>Site Administration </b>in the left panel<b>.</b>

72
00:07:29 --> 00:07:35
Then click on <b>Plugins</b> tab and then<b> Plugins overview</b>.

00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
This will show you the list of all <b>plugins</b>

74
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
The ones which were installed by default and the ones you installed.

75
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
On my site, it shows these many <b>plugins</b> are installed.

76
00:07:51 --> 00:07:58
To see the <b>plugins</b> that were additionally installed, click on <b>Additional plugins</b> link above the table.

77
00:07:59 --> 00:08:04
Here there are links to go to the <b>Settings</b> and <b>uninstall</b> the <b>plugin</b> from this page.

88
00:09:04 --> 00:09:06
Expand the <b>Grade</b> section.

89
00:09:07 --> 00:09:11
This dropdown decides the type of grading used for attendance.

90
00:09:12 --> 00:09:20
If you want attendance to contribute to the course grade, set a Maximum points value.
<p>The default is 100. 
</p>

91
00:09:21 --> 00:09:23
I will select <b>Grade</b> as <b>None</b>.

</p>

97
00:09:47 --> 00:09:52
Depending on your requirement, you can either delete these or add more.

98
00:09:53 --> 00:09:58
You can also modify the status names if you call them something else.

99
00:09:59 --> 00:10:06
I will delete the <b>Excused</b> status because I do not use that in my class.

100
00:10:07 --> 00:10:12
A confirmation message box appears.

00:10:24 --> 00:10:26
Select the start and end time of the session.

104
00:10:27 --> 00:10:42
Note that the time fields use a 24-hour clock.

</p>

105
00:10:43 --> 00:10:45
Type a short <b>Description</b> for the session.

106
00:10:46 --> 00:10:53
If you leave the description field blank, the description by default will be “<b>Regular class session”.</b>

107
00:10:54 --> 00:10:58
Click on <b>Multiple sessions</b> section to expand it.

108
00:10:59 --> 00:11:05
If your class meets at regular intervals, you can create multiple sessions at the same time.

109
00:11:06 --> 00:11:10
Click on <b>Repeat the session above as follows </b>checkbox.

110
00:11:11 --> 00:11:19

113
00:11:35 --> 00:11:37
I will let this remain as 1.

114
00:11:38 --> 00:11:44
This means my class meets every Monday at 3:15pm for 50 mins.

115
00:11:45 --> 00:11:48
<b>Repeat until</b> is the date of the last session.

116
00:11:49 --> 00:11:53

117
00:11:54 --> 00:11:59
Next click on <b>Student recording</b> section to expand it.

118

If you want students to record their own attendance, fill up the fields in this section.

119
00:12:07 --> 00:12:08
I will skip this section.

120
00:12:09 --> 00:12:14
Scroll down and click on <b>Add</b> button at the bottom of the page.

121
00:12:15 --> 00:12:21

00:12:46 --> 00:12:52
You can see a list of all students enrolled in this <b>course</b> and you can mark their <b>attendance</b>.

127
00:12:53 --> 00:12:58
<b>P, L</b> and <b>A</b> are the status that we selected in the <b>settings</b> earlier.

128
00:12:59 --> 00:13:09
Check the radio button just below '<b>P'</b> to set status for all users to '<b>Present'</b> and mark '<b>A'</b> only for the absentees.

129
00:13:10 --> 00:13:17
