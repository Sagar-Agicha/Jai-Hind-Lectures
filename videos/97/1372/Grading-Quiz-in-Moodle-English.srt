However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies.

11
00:01:01 --> 00:01:07
This tutorial assumes that your <b>site administrator</b> has registered you as a <b>teacher</b>

12
00:01:08 --> 00:01:11
And assigned at least one <b>course</b> to you.

13
00:01:12 --> 00:01:24
It also assumes that you have added some course material, assignments and <b>quizzes</b> for your <b>course</b> and  you have some student logins

14
00:01:25 --> 00:01:31
If not, please refer to the relevant <b>Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

15
00:01:32 --> 00:01:39
Let me show you how a student will attempt the <b>quiz</b> that we created earlier in the series.

16
00:01:40 --> 00:01:45
I have logged in as student <b>Priya Sinha</b> right now.

17
00:01:46 --> 00:01:49
I will click on <b>Calculus</b> under <b>My courses</b>.

18
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
Then I will click on <b>Quiz 1 - Evolutes and Involutes</b>

19
00:01:55 --> 00:02:01
I will click on <b>Attempt Quiz now</b> button and then confirm my selection.

20
00:02:02 --> 00:02:05
The question paper is presented to me.

21
00:02:06 --> 00:02:10
On the right, we see the <b>Quiz navigation block.</b>

22
00:02:11 --> 00:02:18
It displays all the question numbers, the timer and the <b>Finish attempt </b>link.

23
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
The questions in the first page are highlighted in the <b>Quiz navigation</b> block.

24
00:02:26 --> 00:02:30
I will begin attempting questions in both the sections.

25
00:02:31 --> 00:02:37
There are buttons for previous and next pages, depending on which page you are in.

26
00:02:38 --> 00:02:43
Let me attempt the questions.

27
00:02:44 --> 00:02:50
I can go back to any question if I need to review it, from the <b>Quiz navigation block</b>.

28
00:02:51 --> 00:02:57
On the left of the question, notice that there is an option to flag the question.

29
00:02:58 --> 00:03:04
A flagged question has a red triangle at the top right of the question.

30
00:03:05 --> 00:03:16
One can flag a question in order to Go back and review it later, before submitting the attempt
<p>Or to discuss the topic with the teacher 
</p>

31
00:03:17 --> 00:03:23
The question will remain flagged until the student specifically removes the flag.

32
00:03:24 --> 00:03:28
There are some other markers related to <b>quiz</b> questions.

33
00:03:29 --> 00:03:33
A grey marker indicates an answered question.

34
00:03:34 --> 00:03:40
A small red triangle below the question number indicates an incomplete answer.

35
00:03:41 --> 00:03:46
A totally white box indicates an unanswered question.

36
00:03:47 --> 00:03:53
As mentioned earlier, I can click on any question to go back to that question.

37
00:03:54 --> 00:04:00
When I am done, I will click on <b>Finish attempt...</b> link in the <b>Quiz navigation block</b>.

38
00:04:01 --> 00:04:06
I can also click on <b>Finish attempt</b> button at the end of the <b>quiz</b>.

39
00:04:07 --> 00:04:12
Click on <b>Submit all and finish</b> button and confirm my selection.

40
00:04:13 --> 00:04:19
Students can see the <b>marks</b> and <b>grade</b> scored in a <b>quiz</b> right after the submission.

41
00:04:20 --> 00:04:25
The <b>quiz navigation block</b> also has color-coded number boxes.

42
00:04:26 --> 00:04:30
A green marker with a tick-mark indicates correct answer

43
00:04:31 --> 00:04:37
A red marker indicates either a wrong or unattempted question

44
00:04:38 --> 00:04:44
A brown marker with a white circle indicates a partially correct answer.

45
00:04:45 --> 00:04:51
A red triangle marker at the top-right is for flagged questions

46
00:04:52 --> 00:04:58
Let us go back to the course page by clicking on <b>Calculus</b> in the breadcrumbs.

47
00:04:59 --> 00:05:01
Let me click on the <b>quiz</b> name.

48
00:05:02 --> 00:05:06
I can see my attempt here and a <b>Review</b> link.

49
00:05:07 --> 00:05:12
I can review my <b>quiz</b> attempt by clicking on the <b>Review</b> link.

50
00:05:13 --> 00:05:17
Scroll down to see the feedback given for every answer.

51
00:05:18 --> 00:05:23
This is a general feedback that every student sees after their attempt.

52
00:05:24 --> 00:05:28
Let me log out of this student’s dashboard.

53
00:05:29 --> 00:05:36
Before reviewing the <b>quiz</b> as a teacher, ensure that all your students have attempted the <b>quiz</b>.

54
00:05:37 --> 00:05:47
Pause the tutorial and attempt the <b>quiz</b> for at least 5 students, before proceeding further.
<p>I have already done so for my students. 
</p>

55
00:05:48 --> 00:05:52
Now, I will login as teacher <b>Rebecca Raymond</b>.

56
00:05:53 --> 00:05:57
Click on <b>Calculus</b> under <b>My courses</b> on the left.

57
00:05:58 --> 00:06:03
Scroll down and click on <b>Quiz 1 - Evolutes and Involutes.</b>

58
00:06:04 --> 00:06:09
You can see <b>quiz</b> description and <b>quiz</b> timeline in this page.

59
00:06:10 --> 00:06:16
The number of attempts are also listed here.
<p>In my case, it is 5. 
</p>

60
00:06:17 --> 00:06:20
Now, click on <b>Attempts</b> link.

61
00:06:21 --> 00:06:26
There are some filters at the top of the page, which are self-explanatory.

62
00:06:27 --> 00:06:31
You can use these if there are many students enrolled in your course.

63
00:06:32 --> 00:06:35
I will leave them as they are and scroll down.

64
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
Let me close the <b>navigation</b> menu on the left for better view.

65
00:06:42 --> 00:06:46
Notice that all the attempts are listed in a table here.

66
00:06:47 --> 00:06:51
Click on <b>Review attempt </b>link below <b>Priya Sinha’s</b> name.

67
00:06:52 --> 00:06:56
You may see a different set of questions than the ones I see.

68
00:06:57 --> 00:07:04
That is because we added random questions from the question bank, while creating the <b>quiz</b>.

69
00:07:05 --> 00:07:11
The students will see different questions or a different order of questions, when they attempt.

70
00:07:12 --> 00:07:16
We can see a brief overview of the attempt.

71
00:07:17 --> 00:07:22
<b>Priya Sinha</b> finished the <b>quiz</b> in 3 minutes and 12 seconds.

72
00:07:23 --> 00:07:29
She also got 1.2 out of 4 marks and 30%.

73
00:07:30 --> 00:07:35
This will give you an idea of how the student performed in the <b>quiz</b>.

74
00:07:36 --> 00:07:39
Look at the<b> Quiz navigation block</b> at the right.

75
00:07:40 --> 00:07:46
The green box with a tick mark indicates that the student got full marks for the answer.

76
00:07:47 --> 00:07:52
The red box indicates that the student answered the question incorrectly.

77
00:07:53 --> 00:07:59
The brown box with a white circle in between indicates partially correct answer.

78
00:08:00 --> 00:08:05
You can go to any question directly by clicking on that question number.

79
00:08:06 --> 00:08:12
You can also change the layout if you want to show the questions one page at a time.

80
00:08:13 --> 00:08:18
You can see the answers and the marks scored against each question.

81
00:08:19 --> 00:08:23
You can also see the common feedback shown to the student.

82
00:08:24 --> 00:08:29
There is also a <b>Response history</b> with a log of what the student did.

83
00:08:30 --> 00:08:36
Notice here that the student saved this answer once before finally submitting it.

84
00:08:37 --> 00:08:42
As a teacher, you can add a specific comment for any answer, if you wish to.

85
00:08:43 --> 00:08:48
You can also override the marks. Let’s see how to do this.

86
00:08:49 --> 00:08:58
Click on <b>Make comment or override marks</b> link below the common feedback section.
<p>A new window opens up. 
</p>

87
00:08:59 --> 00:09:02
Type the desired <b>comment</b>, as shown here.

88
00:09:03 --> 00:09:06
I will also change the marks as shown here.

89
00:09:07 --> 00:09:10
Scroll down and click on the <b>Save</b> button.

90
00:09:11 --> 00:09:15
Your <b>comment</b> is now shown below the common feedback.

91
00:09:16 --> 00:09:21
<b>Response history</b> also has a log of the changes you made.

92
00:09:22 --> 00:09:28
Notice that the marks and grade have also changed based on your new manual grading.

93
00:09:29 --> 00:09:37
You can also edit a question from an attempt itself.
<p>Click on <b>Edit question</b> link on the left. 
</p>

94
00:09:38 --> 00:09:43
This will take you to the edit screen where you can make changes to the question.

95
00:09:44 --> 00:09:48
You can also change the options of grades associated with it.

96
00:09:49 --> 00:09:59
Note that this will change the question for all students who have already attempted the <b>quiz</b>.
<p>This will also change the question for future <b>quizzes</b>. 
</p>

97
00:10:00 --> 00:10:05
I realize now that I had marked the wrong answer while creating this <b>quiz</b>.

98
00:10:06 --> 00:10:11
I will change the grade for these 2 options.

99
00:10:12 --> 00:10:15
Click on <b>Save changes</b> button when done.

100
00:10:16 --> 00:10:19
Click on <b>Finish review </b>link when you are done.

101
00:10:20 --> 00:10:23
Click on <b>Attempts</b> link again.

102
00:10:24 --> 00:10:29
If you changed any question, you should regrade the attempts based on the new grading.

103
00:10:30 --> 00:10:34
Click on <b>Regrade all </b>button.

104
00:10:35 --> 00:10:42
You will see a message <b>Regrade completed successfully.</b>
<p>Click on <b>Continue</b> button. 
</p>

105
00:10:43 --> 00:10:48
Notice that the grade for that question changed for some of the students.

106
00:10:49 --> 00:10:53
You can also delete a particular attempt if you wish to.

107
00:10:54 --> 00:11:00
Click on the checkbox next to the name of the student whose attempt you want to delete.

108
00:11:01 --> 00:11:08
Then click on<b> Delete selected attempts</b> button. But I will not do this right now.

109
00:11:09 --> 00:11:18
The teacher also has the option to download all the attempts in various file formats.
<p>Let me demonstrate how. 
</p>

110
00:11:19 --> 00:11:23
Scroll up to the section <b>What to include in the report </b>

111
00:11:24 --> 00:11:28
I can filter the reports based on various criteria.

112
00:11:29 --> 00:11:35
Let me download the report for all enrolled students who have attempted the <b>quiz</b>.

113
00:11:36 --> 00:11:45
I will uncheck rest of the checkboxes under <b>Attempts that are</b> to narrow it down to see the finished reports
