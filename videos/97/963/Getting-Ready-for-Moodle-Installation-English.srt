Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Getting ready for Moodle installation.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:13
In this tutorial, we will learn about the prerequisites for installing <b>Moodle.</b>

3
00:00:14 --> 00:00:21
We will also learn to check for <b>packages</b> on <b>localhost</b> and database setup.

4
00:00:22 --> 00:00:29
To record this tutorial, I will be using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS </b>16.04,
</p>

5
00:00:30 --> 00:00:41
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30 </b> and <b>Firefox </b>web browser.

6
00:00:42 --> 00:00:45
You can use any web browser of your choice.

7
00:00:46 --> 00:00:51
To install <b>Moodle 3.3</b> in your system, you should have a machine that supports:

8
00:00:52 --> 00:01:07
<b>Apache</b> 2.x (or higher version),
<p><b>MariaDB </b>5.5.30 (or any higher version) and
</p><p><b>PHP</b> 5.4.4 +(or any higher version).
</p>

9
00:01:08 --> 00:01:15
If you have older versions of the above, ideally uninstall these before proceeding ahead.

10
00:01:16 --> 00:01:20
<b>MariaDB</b> is the fastest growing open source database.

11
00:01:21 --> 00:01:25
It is an alternative for <b>MySQL</b> database.

12
00:01:26 --> 00:01:33
<b>Web server</b> distributions give you <b> Apache</b>,<b> MariaDB</b> and<b> PHP</b> bundled in one.

13
00:01:34 --> 00:01:43
You can either install these separately or using a web server distribution like<b> XAMPP</b>,<b> WAMPP</b> or<b> LAMPP</b>.

14
00:01:44 --> 00:01:48
I have already installed <b>XAMPP</b> in my machine.

15
00:01:49 --> 00:01:53
First of all, we should check if <b>XAMPP</b> is running on our machine.

16
00:01:54 --> 00:02:07
In the web browser, type: <b>http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 </b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

17
00:02:08 --> 00:02:11
It shows a message <b>Unable to connect</b>.

18
00:02:12 --> 00:02:15
This means, <b>XAMPP </b>service is not running.

19
00:02:16 --> 00:02:19
So, we have to start the <b>XAMPP service.</b>

20
00:02:20 --> 00:02:25
Let’s open the <b>terminal</b> by pressing <b>Ctrl + Alt + T</b> keys together.

21
00:02:26 --> 00:02:37
Start <b>XAMPP</b> by typing <b>sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash lampp space start</b>.

22
00:02:38 --> 00:02:43
Enter the <b>administrative</b> password when prompted and press <b>Enter</b>.

23
00:02:44 --> 00:02:58
If you get a message that says-
<p><b>Starting XAMPP for Linux </b>….
</p><p><b>XAMPP: Starting Apache...ok.</b>
</p><p><b>XAMPP: Starting MySQL...ok.</b>
</p><p><b>XAMPP: Starting ProFTPD...ok.</b>
</p>

24
00:02:59 --> 00:03:04
It means that <b>XAMPP</b> is installed in your system and you have started the service.

25
00:03:05 --> 00:03:12
Please note <b>XAMPP 5.6.30</b> uses <b>MariaDB</b> instead of <b>MySQL</b>.

26
00:03:13 --> 00:03:16
The <b>command</b>s and <b>tool</b>s are the same for both.

27
00:03:17 --> 00:03:20
Let us go back to the browser and <b>refresh</b> the page.

28
00:03:21 --> 00:03:24
We can now see the <b>XAMPP screen</b>.

29
00:03:25 --> 00:03:29
You may get a message saying <b>Command not found</b> in the <b>terminal</b>.

30
00:03:30 --> 00:03:33
This means <b>XAMPP</b> is not installed in your machine.

31
00:03:34 --> 00:03:41
If so, refer to the <b>XAMPP Installation</b> tutorial in the <b>PHP and MySQL </b> series on this website.

32
00:03:42 --> 00:03:48
Follow the instructions specified in the above tutorial and install the latest version of <b>XAMPP</b>.

33
00:03:49 --> 00:03:51
Let’s switch back to the <b>terminal</b>.

34
00:03:52 --> 00:03:56
Now follow the steps shown above to start <b>XAMPP service</b>.

35
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
Let us check the version of <b>PHP</b> on our system now.

36
00:04:02 --> 00:04:16
On the <b>terminal</b> type: <b>sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash php space hyphen v</b>
<p>and press <b>Enter.</b>
</p>

37
00:04:17 --> 00:04:22
Enter the <b>administrative</b> password, if prompted, and press <b>Enter</b>.

38
00:04:23 --> 00:04:28
My version of <b>PHP </b>is <b>5.6.30</b>.

39
00:04:29 --> 00:04:33
This message indicates that <b>PHP </b> is installed successfully.

40
00:04:34 --> 00:04:41
If you get a version lesser than <b>5.4.4</b>, you should install the latest version of <b>XAMPP</b>.

41
00:04:42 --> 00:04:47
Next, let us check the version of <b>MariaDB</b> on our system.

42
00:04:48 --> 00:05:02
On the <b>terminal</b>, type: <b>sudo space slash opt slash lampp slash bin slash mysql space hyphen v</b>
<p>and press <b>Enter</b>.
</p>

43
00:05:03 --> 00:05:07
Enter the <b>administrative</b> password, if prompted, and press <b>Enter</b>.

44
00:05:08 --> 00:05:13
My version of <b>MariaDB </b>is <b>10.1.21</b>

45
00:05:14 --> 00:05:22
If you get a version lesser than <b>5.5.30</b>, you should install the latest version of <b>XAMPP</b>.

46
00:05:23 --> 00:05:28
Please note. You should have <b>XAMPP</b> running to check the versions of <b>PHP</b> and database.

47
00:05:29 --> 00:05:33
Also note that the <b>command prompt </b>has now changed.

48
00:05:34 --> 00:05:39
Type <b>backslash q</b> and press <b>Enter </b> to exit <b>MariaDB</b>.

49
00:05:40 --> 00:05:43
You may also get other <b>error</b>s as shown here.

50
00:05:44 --> 00:05:49
You may get a message that says “<b>An apache daemon is already running”.</b>

51
00:05:50 --> 00:05:54
It means the startup script did not start<b> XAMPP-Apache.</b>

52
00:05:55 --> 00:06:00
This indicates that there is another <b>Apache instance</b> already running.

53
00:06:01 --> 00:06:05
To start <b>XAMPP </b>properly, you will have to first stop this <b>daemon</b>.

54
00:06:06 --> 00:06:18
The command to stop <b>Apache</b> is:
<p><b>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 space stop</b>
</p>

55
00:06:19 --> 00:06:24
You may get a message that says <b>MySQL daemon failed to start.</b>

56
00:06:25 --> 00:06:29
This means the startup script did not start <b>MySQL</b>.

57
00:06:30 --> 00:06:35
This indicates that there is another <b>database instance</b> already running.

58
00:06:36 --> 00:06:40
To start <b>XAMPP</b> properly, first you have to stop this <b>daemon.</b>

59
00:06:41 --> 00:06:53
This command will stop <b>MySQL</b>: <b>sudo space /etc/init.d/mysql space stop </b>

60
00:06:54 --> 00:06:58
Resolve all the errors and get <b>XAMPP</b> running successfully.

61
00:06:59 --> 00:07:02
Then switch to your web browser and <b>refresh</b> the page.

62
00:07:03 --> 00:07:07
If prompted for language selection, select <b>English</b>.

63
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
We will now need to add a user and create a <b>database</b> for <b>Moodle</b>.

64
00:07:14 --> 00:07:20
We will do this in <b>phpmyadmin</b> which is the graphical user interface for <b>MariaDB</b>.

65
00:07:21 --> 00:07:24
It comes along with the <b>XAMPP</b> installation.

66
00:07:25 --> 00:07:27
Let us go back to the browser.

67
00:07:28 --> 00:07:33
On the <b>XAMPP</b> page, in the menu at the top, click on <b>phpMyadmin</b>.

68
00:07:34 --> 00:07:41
Click on <b>User Accounts</b> in the top menu and then click on <b>Add User Account</b>.

69
00:07:42 --> 00:07:47
In the new <b>window</b> that opens, enter a <b>username </b>of your choice.

70
00:07:48 --> 00:07:52
I will type: <b>moodle hyphen st </b>as my <b>username.</b>

71
00:07:53 --> 00:07:56
From the <b>Host</b> drop-down list, select <b>Local</b>.

72
00:07:57 --> 00:08:01
Enter a password of your choice in the <b>Password</b> text-box.

73
00:08:02 --> 00:08:06
I will type: <b>moodle hyphen st </b>as my <b>password</b>.

74
00:08:07 --> 00:08:11
Type the same password in the <b>Re-type</b> textbox.

75
00:08:12 --> 00:08:16
Keep the<b> Authentication Plugin </b>option as it is.

76
00:08:17 --> 00:08:21
Please do not click on <b>Generate Password</b> prompt for now.

77
00:08:22 --> 00:08:25
Under <b>Database for user account</b>, we can see the option-

78
00:08:26 --> 00:08:30
<b>Create database with same name and grant all privileges.</b>

79
00:08:31 --> 00:08:37
We will check that option and click the<b> Go</b> button at the bottom right of this page.

80
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
We can see a message <b>“You have added a new user”</b> at the top of the window.

81
00:08:44 --> 00:08:53
It means a new <b>database</b> with the name <b>moodle-st</b> and with a user <b>moodle-st </b>has been created.

82
00:08:54 --> 00:08:58
Make a note of the <b>username, password</b> and <b>database</b> names.

83
00:08:59 --> 00:09:03
These will be required later to complete the <b>Moodle</b> installation.

84
00:09:04 --> 00:09:09
Please note: <b>Database</b> name and <b>username</b> need not be the same.

85
00:09:10 --> 00:09:17
To have different names, create the <b>database</b> first and then create a user for that <b>database</b>.

86
00:09:18 --> 00:09:24
Also, as per naming convention, <b>username</b> should not have any spaces in between.

87
00:09:25 --> 00:09:28
We now have <b>XAMPP</b> running and our <b>database</b> is ready.

88
00:09:29 --> 00:09:31
We are now ready to install <b>Moodle</b>.

89
00:09:32 --> 00:09:36
We will continue with the installation of <b>Moodle</b> in the next tutorial.

90
00:09:37 --> 00:09:40
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial.

91
00:09:41 --> 00:09:42
Let us summarize.

92
00:09:43 --> 00:09:44
