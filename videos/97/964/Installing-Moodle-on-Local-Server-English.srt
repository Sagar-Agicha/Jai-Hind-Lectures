Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Installing Moodle on Local Server</b>.

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:14
In this tutorial, we will learn how to download Moodle and install Moodle.

3
00:00:15 --> 00:00:22
To install <b>Moodle</b>, you should have a system supporting:
<p><b>Apache</b> 2.x (or higher version), 
</p>

4
00:00:23 --> 00:00:35
<b>MariaDB </b>5.5.30 (or any higher version) and  <b>PHP</b> 5.4.4 +(or any higher version).

5
00:00:36 --> 00:00:43
To record this tutorial, I will be using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS </b>16.04, 
</p>

6
00:00:44 --> 00:00:52
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30 </b>

7
00:00:53 --> 00:00:58
<b>Moodle</b> 3.3 and <b>Firefox </b>web browser.

8
00:00:59 --> 00:01:02
You can use any web browser of your choice.

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:10
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
Please ensure that you have internet connectivity before you begin.

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:26
Also refer to the previous tutorials in this series.
<p>And, ensure that the prerequisites are met and the <b>database</b> is setup properly. 
</p>

12
00:01:27 --> 00:01:36
We should have <b>XAMPP</b> running and We should have a database set up with <b>username moodle-st</b>.

13
00:01:37 --> 00:01:41
First, let me go to the web browser and launch <b>XAMPP.</b>

14
00:01:42 --> 00:01:55
In the <b>address bar</b>, type: <b>http colon double slash 127 dot 0 dot 0 dot 1 </b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

15
00:01:56 --> 00:02:01
In the menu at the top right of the screen, click on <b>PHPinfo.</b>

16
00:02:02 --> 00:02:09
Now, press <b>Ctrl + F</b> keys and search for <b>DOCUMENT underscore ROOT.</b>

17
00:02:10 --> 00:02:13
It will be found in the table <b>Apache Environment</b>.

18
00:02:14 --> 00:02:29
The value of <b>DOCUMENT underscore ROOT</b> will be either  <b>slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs </b>or <b>slash var slash www</b>

19
00:02:30 --> 00:02:36
In my machine, it is <b>slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs.</b>

20
00:02:37 --> 00:02:42
Please make a note of this <b>path</b>. We are going to install <b>Moodle</b> here.

21
00:02:43 --> 00:02:52
Let’s now start downloading <b>Moodle</b>.
<p>Go to the official website of <b>Moodle</b> which is <b>moodle.org</b>. 
</p>

22
00:02:53 --> 00:03:03
Click on the <b>Downloads</b> link in the top menu.
<p>And then, click on the latest release button <b>MOODLE 3.3+. </b>
</p>

23
00:03:04 --> 00:03:14
At the time of recording this tutorial, the latest stable <b>Moodle</b> version is 3.3. It could be different when you try.

24
00:03:15 --> 00:03:21
Click on the <b>Download zip</b> button. This will start downloading <b>Moodle</b> on our machine.

25
00:03:22 --> 00:03:29
I have already downloaded this file and it is in my <b>Downloads</b> folder. So I will skip this step.

26
00:03:30 --> 00:03:35
Open the terminal by pressing <b>Ctrl + Alt + T</b> keys together.

27
00:03:36 --> 00:03:39
On the terminal, I will change the directory to <b>Downloads.</b>

28
00:03:40 --> 00:03:47
To do that, type the command: <b>cd space Downloads</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

29
00:03:48 --> 00:03:52
You will have to type the<b> path </b>where you downloaded <b>Moodle</b> on your system.

30
00:03:53 --> 00:04:00
Once you are in that directory, type <b>ls</b> and press <b>Enter</b> to list the files therein.

31
00:04:01 --> 00:04:10
Here is my <b>Moodle</b> installation file.  It has the name <b>moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip</b>.

32
00:04:11 --> 00:04:18
If you had renamed it to some other name during download, then locate that file in your folder.

33
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
Next, we have to <b>extract</b> the contents of this <b>zip</b> file into the <b>moodle</b> folder.

34
00:04:26 --> 00:04:50
At the <b>command prompt</b>, type: <b>sudo space unzip space moodle hyphen latest hyphen 33 dot zip space hyphen d space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs slash</b>. Now press <b>Enter.</b>

35
00:04:51 --> 00:04:55
Let’s clear the terminal by pressing <b>Ctrl + L.</b>

36
00:04:56 --> 00:05:05
Now type: <b>cd space slash opt slash lampp slash htdocs</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

37
00:05:06 --> 00:05:11
To list the files in this directory, type <b>ls</b> and press <b>Enter</b>.

38
00:05:12 --> 00:05:17
You can see that a new folder named <b>moodle</b> has been created.

39
00:05:18 --> 00:05:26
Let us give <b>read, write</b> and <b>execute permissions</b> to the <b>owner</b> and the <b>group members</b> of <b>moodle</b> folder.

40
00:05:27 --> 00:05:38
So, type: <b>sudo space chmod space 777 space moodle slash</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

41
00:05:39 --> 00:05:44
Enter the <b>administrative </b>password, if prompted, and press <b>Enter.</b>

42
00:05:45 --> 00:06:05
Now switch to the browser and type: <b>http colon double slash 127.0.0.1 slash moodle </b> or <b>http colon double slash localhost slash moodle</b>.

43
00:06:06 --> 00:06:09
I have typed my <b>localhost IP</b> here.

44
00:06:10 --> 00:06:22
This <b>IP</b> necessarily has to be the <b>IP</b> of the machine on which <b>moodle</b> is installed.
<p>Please note that <b>moodle</b> is the folder into which we had extracted earlier. 
</p>

45
00:06:23 --> 00:06:28
Press <b>Enter</b> and you will see the <b>Moodle</b> installation page.

46
00:06:29 --> 00:06:39
By default, we are in step number one, that is, <b>Configuration.</b> Please note: <b>Moodle</b> can be installed in multiple languages.

47
00:06:40 --> 00:06:51
But we will limit ourselves to English language only.
<p>So, select <b>English </b>here. Click on <b>Next</b> button below the <b>Language</b> dropdown. 
</p>

48
00:06:52 --> 00:07:01
Next is the <b>Paths</b> page. This is where the <b>Web address, Moodle directory</b> and <b>Data directory</b> are defined.

49
00:07:02 --> 00:07:07
<b>Web address</b> is the <b>URL</b> for us to access <b>Moodle</b> once installed.

50
00:07:08 --> 00:07:13
This is the same <b>URL</b> that we entered above which is shown here.

51
00:07:14 --> 00:07:19
<b>Moodle directory</b> is the folder where all the <b>Moodle</b> code is available.

52
00:07:20 --> 00:07:30
Notice here, both <b>Web address </b>and <b>Moodle directory</b> are non-editable <b>field</b>s. These cannot be changed by us.

53
00:07:31 --> 00:07:41
Next is the <b>Data directory</b>. This is the folder where all file content uploaded by teachers and students will be stored.

54
00:07:42 --> 00:07:49
This folder needs to have <b>read</b> and <b>write permission</b>. So, the files can be stored here.

55
00:07:50 --> 00:07:56
However, it should not be directly accessible on the web for security reasons.

56
00:07:57 --> 00:08:02
So, it is to be kept outside of the installation folder.

57
00:08:03 --> 00:08:10
<b>moodledata</b> inside the folder <b>lampp</b> is the default <b>data directory</b> which the <b>installer</b> tries to create.

58
00:08:11 --> 00:08:22
However, it does not have the permission to create a folder here.
<p>So, we have to create this folder manually and give it the required <b>permission</b>s. 
</p>

59
00:08:23 --> 00:08:40
Go to the <b>terminal</b> window. At the <b>prompt</b>, type: <b>sudo space mkdir space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

60
00:08:41 --> 00:08:56
Now, type: <b>sudo space chmod space 777 space slash opt slash lampp slash moodledata</b> and press <b>Enter.</b>

61
00:08:57 --> 00:09:01
Go back to the browser now and click on <b>Next</b> button.

62
00:09:02 --> 00:09:12
After this comes the <b>database configuration</b> page.
<p>Select <b>MariaDB</b> from the dropdown and click on the <b>Next</b> button. 
</p>

63
00:09:13 --> 00:09:17
Enter <b>localhost</b> as the  <b>Database Host Name.</b>

64
00:09:18 --> 00:09:29
Now, we have to enter the <b>database name, username</b> and <b>password</b>.
<p>These are the ones we created earlier in <b>phpMyAdmin.</b>
</p>

65
00:09:30 --> 00:09:35
I will enter <b>moodle-st</b> as the <b>database name.</b>

66
00:09:36 --> 00:09:40
Then <b>moodle-st</b> as the <b>database username.</b>

67
00:09:41 --> 00:09:45
And, <b>moodle-st</b> as my<b> database password.</b>

68
00:09:46 --> 00:09:53
Leave the <b>Table Prefix </b>and the other <b>field</b>s as they are and click on <b>Next.</b>

69
00:09:54 --> 00:09:58
We can see a <b>terms and conditions</b> page.

70
00:09:59 --> 00:10:09
This is the step where you need to read the license agreement and agree to the same.
<p>Read the text and then click on <b>Continue.</b>
</p>

71
00:10:10 --> 00:10:22
We can see the <b>Server Checks </b>page next.
<p>Scroll down to see the message <b>Your server environment meets all minimum requirements</b>. 
</p>

72
00:10:23 --> 00:10:32
You may get other <b>error</b>s as shown:
<p>Refer to the <b>Additional reading material </b>link of this tutorial for the solution. 
</p>

73
00:10:33 --> 00:10:35
Click on <b>Continue.</b>

74
00:10:36 --> 00:10:49
This step may take some time depending on your <b>internet</b> speed.
<p>You may get an error message <b>Site is being upgraded, please retry later</b> if you <b>refresh</b> the page. 
</p>

75
00:10:50 --> 00:10:53
In that case, please refresh after some time.

76
00:10:54 --> 00:10:59
Click <b>Continue</b> when you get a success message for the installation.

77
00:11:00 --> 00:11:04
The next page is for <b>administrator configuration.</b>

78
00:11:05 --> 00:11:14
Enter the <b>username</b> that you want for the <b>Moodle Administrative</b> page. I will enter the <b>username</b> as <b>admin.</b>

79
00:11:15 --> 00:11:25
Now enter a password for the <b>Moodle Administrator.</b>
<p>The password here must follow these rules as shown here. 
</p>

80
00:11:26 --> 00:11:31
To enter the password, click on <b>Click to enter text</b> link.

81
00:11:32 --> 00:11:42
I will enter <b>Spokentutorial1@</b> as my <b>admin password.</b> Click on <b>Unmask</b> icon to reveal the password.

82
00:11:43 --> 00:11:48
Note down the <b>username</b> and <b>password</b> that you have created for future use.

83
00:11:49 --> 00:11:58
<b>Email address</b> is a mandatory field.
<p>I will enter <b>priyankaspokentutorial@gmail.com</b> here. 
</p>

84
00:11:59 --> 00:12:07
In <b>Select a country</b> drop-down, select <b>India.</b>
<p>Select the timezone as <b>Asia/Kolkata</b>. 
</p>

85
00:12:08 --> 00:12:12
We will leave rest of the <b>field</b>s with their default values.

86
00:12:13 --> 00:12:17
Scroll down and click on <b>Update Profile</b> button.

87
00:12:18 --> 00:12:26
Please note that <b>Moodle</b> is a resource consuming software. Every step may take time to complete.

88
00:12:27 --> 00:12:33
Please wait for the next page to <b>load</b> and do not close or <b>refresh</b> the page.

89
00:12:34 --> 00:12:44
The next screen is for<b> Front page settings</b>. This is the page people will see when they visit our <b>moodle site.</b>

90
00:12:45 --> 00:12:49
Enter <b>Digital India LMS</b> as the <b>Full Site Name.</b>

91
00:12:50 --> 00:13:02
Enter <b>Digital India LMS</b> again as the <b>Short name for site. </b>
<p>This is what will be visible as the name of the <b>moodle site</b> in the navigation bar. 
</p>

92
00:13:03 --> 00:13:10
Let us leave the <b>Front Page Summary</b> as blank, for now.
<p>Select the timezone as <b>Asia/Kolkata.</b>
</p>

93
00:13:11 --> 00:13:22
The next dropdown is <b>Self Registration</b>. If <b>Self Registration </b>is enabled, then new users can register themselves on their own.

94
00:13:23 --> 00:13:30
Select <b>Disable </b>from the dropdown.
<p>Next is the text box <b>no-reply address</b>. 
</p>

95
00:13:31 --> 00:13:45
The default value in this field is<b> noreply@localhost. </b>
<p>Since this is not a valid <b>email ID</b>, change it to <b>noreply@localhost.com</b>. 
</p>

96
00:13:46 --> 00:13:54
This email ID will be shown as <b>From</b> address, when <b>Moodle</b> does not have any email ID to show.

97
00:13:55 --> 00:14:09
For example, if I specify to keep my address as<b> private</b>, all mails sent on my behalf will have this email ID.
<p>Lastly, click on <b>Save Changes </b>button. 
</p>

98
00:14:10 --> 00:14:16
We are now ready to use <b>Moodle. </b>
<p>You can see the front page of the new site here. 
</p>

99
00:14:17 --> 00:14:22
