<b>Narration</b>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:06
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Admin’s dashboard </b>in<b> Moodle.</b>

2
00:00:07 --> 00:00:21
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
<p>various <b>blocks</b> on the <b>Admin’s dashboard, </b>
</p><p><b>Admin’s profile page </b>and
</p><p>how to edit <b>preferences</b>.
</p>

3
00:00:22 --> 00:00:45
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,
</p><p><b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,
</p><p><b>Moodle 3.3 </b> and <b>Firefox </b>web browser. 
</p>

4
00:00:46 --> 00:00:49
You may use any web browser of your choice.

5
00:00:50 --> 00:00:58
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

6
00:00:59 --> 00:01:12
Learners of this tutorial should have <b>Moodle 3.3</b> installed on their system.
<p>If not, please refer to the relevant<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.
</p>

7
00:01:13 --> 00:01:20
Switch to the browser and open your <b>moodle site.</b> Make sure that the <b>XAMPP service</b> is running.

8
00:01:21 --> 00:01:32
You can see a blank page with only the <b>header</b>s.  This is because we have not set any <b>front page </b>for our installation.

9
00:01:33 --> 00:01:38
Click on <b>Log in</b> link at the top right corner of the window.

10
00:01:39 --> 00:01:46
Log in using your <b>admin username </b>and <b>password</b> that you had given when you installed <b>Moodle</b>.

11
00:01:47 --> 00:01:58
I will enter <b>admin</b> as the <b>username</b> and <b>Spokentutorial1@ </b>as the <b>password</b>.  Then click on <b>Log in</b> button.

12
00:01:59 --> 00:02:03
The page that we see now is called the <b>dashboard</b>.

13
00:02:04 --> 00:02:07
We can see that our <b>dashboard</b> is divided into 2 <b>column</b>s.

14
00:02:08 --> 00:02:12
The wider one on the left, is the main <b>Content column. </b>

15
00:02:13 --> 00:02:16
The one on the right is the <b>Blocks column</b>.

16
00:02:17 --> 00:02:24
<b>Blocks</b> are items in these <b>columns</b> that serve a specific purpose or information.

17
00:02:25 --> 00:02:34
<b>Blocks</b> are found on all pages of <b>Moodle</b>.
<p>You can think of them as shortcuts to critical parts of your course.
</p>

18
00:02:35 --> 00:02:45
For eg. <b>Private Files</b>, <b>Online Users</b>, <b>Course Overview </b>etc. are the <b>blocks</b> on my <b>dashboard</b>.

19
00:02:46 --> 00:02:49
Notice that there are no activities or <b>course</b>s here.

20
00:02:50 --> 00:02:55
This is because we have not created any course yet.

21
00:02:56 --> 00:03:07
A list of all courses will be seen- if a user (i.e a teacher or student or admin)  is enrolled or assigned a role in <b>courses</b>.

22
00:03:08 --> 00:03:16
Also notice that the <b>Online Users block</b> shows <b>Admin User</b> which is our current login.

23
00:03:17 --> 00:03:22
This <b>block </b>shows all the  logged in users at any given point of time.

24
00:03:23 --> 00:03:33
Every <b>block</b> in <b>Moodle </b>has a specific purpose. We can add <b>blocks</b> to any <b>column</b> of any <b>page</b> in <b>Moodle</b>.

25
00:03:34 --> 00:03:37
Let us now look at the <b>header</b> of the <b>page</b>.

26
00:03:38 --> 00:03:54
On the top left corner, we can see a <b>Navigation Drawer </b>or<b> Navigation menu.</b> This helps us to access <b>Calendar</b> and other <b>Administration</b> links. This is a <b>toggle menu</b>

27
00:03:55 --> 00:04:03
which means it changes its <b>status </b>from <b>open </b>to <b>close </b>and vice-versa when clicked.

28
00:04:04 --> 00:04:07
We then have the placeholder for the <b>logo</b>.

29
00:04:08 --> 00:04:17
By default, this is the short site name. Clicking on this, will get us to the <b>dashboard</b> from any <b>page</b>.

30
00:04:18 --> 00:04:25
At the top right, there are quick access <b>icon</b>s for <b>notifications</b> and <b>messages</b>.

31
00:04:26 --> 00:04:34
Next to that is the drop-down <b>user menu</b>.  It is also called the <b>quick access user menu</b>.

32
00:04:35 --> 00:04:40
We will discuss the <b>Profile </b>and <b>Preferences page </b>in brief, in this tutorial.

33
00:04:41 --> 00:04:47
All these <b>menu items</b> are also<b> toggle menus</b>, similar to the one on the left.

34
00:04:48 --> 00:04:51
Next, click on the <b>Profile</b> link.

35
00:04:52 --> 00:04:56
Every user in <b>Moodle</b> has a <b>profile page</b>.

36
00:04:57 --> 00:05:06
It has <b>link</b>s to   allow <b>users</b> to edit their profile information, view their <b>forum</b> or <b>blog posts</b>,

37
00:05:07 --> 00:05:17
check any <b>reports</b> they have access to and view their <b>access logs</b> and the <b>IP address</b> that was used to login the last time.

38
00:05:18 --> 00:05:25
Now let’s click on the <b>Edit Profile</b> link. The <b>Edit Profile page</b> opens up.

39
00:05:26 --> 00:05:38
This page is divided into 5 sections:
<p><b>General</b>,
</p><p><b>User Picture</b>,
</p><p><b>Additional Names</b>,
</p><p><b>Interests</b>,
</p><p><b>Optional</b>.
</p>

40
00:05:39 --> 00:05:42
The <b>General</b> section is expanded, by default.

41
00:05:43 --> 00:05:48
Clicking on any section name expands or collapses it.

42
00:05:49 --> 00:05:54
The <b>‘Expand all’ </b>link on the right, expands all the sections.

43
00:05:55 --> 00:05:58
All fields here are editable.

44
00:05:59 --> 00:06:03
Let’s add <b>City / Town. </b>I will type <b>Mumbai.</b>

45
00:06:04 --> 00:06:12
Ensure that <b>India</b> is selected in the <b>Select a country</b> drop-down. And, <b>timezone </b>is set to <b>Asia/Kolkata</b>.

46
00:06:13 --> 00:06:17
Only <b>Admins</b> can change <b>password</b> from this profile page.

47
00:06:18 --> 00:06:21
Let me add a few <b>field</b>s in the <b>Optional</b> section.

48
00:06:22 --> 00:06:35
I will enter <b>IIT Bombay </b>in the <b>Institution </b>field. Also, <b>Mathematics </b>in <b>Department</b> and a valid phone number in the <b>Phone number</b> field.

49
00:06:36 --> 00:06:41
Then click on <b>Update Profile </b>button to <b>save</b> the page.

50
00:06:42 --> 00:06:50
Now, click on the <b>quick access user menu</b> at the top right, again.
<p>Click on the <b>Preferences</b> link.
</p>

51
00:06:51 --> 00:06:58
The <b>Preferences</b> page gives users quick access to various settings they may wish to edit.

52
00:06:59 --> 00:07:11
<b>Preferences</b> page for an <b>admin account </b>is divided into 4 sections:
<p><b>User account,</b>
<b>Roles,</b>
<b>Blogs, </b>and  <b>Badges</b>.
</p>

53
00:07:12 --> 00:07:18
The <b>User Account</b> section allows the <b>user </b> to <b>Edit Profile</b> and <b>Change Password</b>.

54
00:07:19 --> 00:07:29
It also sets <b>preferences </b>for <b>Language, Forum, Calendar, Message, Notification </b>etc.

55
00:07:30 --> 00:07:33
Let’s click on the <b>Calendar preferences</b>.

56
00:07:34 --> 00:07:39
We will set the <b>calendar</b> to display time in <b>24 hour</b> format.

57
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
Also, we will set the <b>Upcoming events look-ahead</b> to <b>2 weeks</b>.

58
00:07:46 --> 00:07:54
This means we’ll see notifications for all events happening in the next 2 weeks on the calendar.

59
00:07:55 --> 00:07:59
I want to highlight the <b>help </b>icon next to all the <b>field</b>s.

60
00:08:00 --> 00:08:07
Clicking on this, will open a <b>help box </b>with a short description of what the <b>field </b>stands for.

61
00:08:08 --> 00:08:15
When in doubt about any <b>field</b>, always click on the <b>help </b>icon to understand its significance.

62
00:08:16 --> 00:08:22
Let all the other options remain as they are. Click on <b>Save Changes </b>button.

63
00:08:23 --> 00:08:29
We will go through the rest of the preferences when we discuss those features later in this series.

64
00:08:30 --> 00:08:32
Notice the information here.

65
00:08:33 --> 00:08:44
This is the <b>breadcrumb navigation.</b> It’s a visual aid that indicates which page we are on, within the <b>Moodle site</b>’s hierarchy.

66
00:08:45 --> 00:08:50
It helps us to go back to a higher-level page with a single click.

67
00:08:51 --> 00:08:56
Click on the <b>Dashboard </b>link in the <b>breadcrumbs</b> to go to the <b>dashboard</b>.

68
00:08:57 --> 00:09:02
With this, we come to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

69
00:09:03 --> 00:09:15
In this tutorial, we learnt about:
<p>various <b>blocks</b> on the <b>admin’s dashboard</b>,
</p><p><b>Admin’s profile page</b> and
</p><p>how to edit <b>preferences</b>.
</p>

70
00:09:16 --> 00:09:26
Here is a small assignment for you.
<p>Click on the <b>Message Preferences</b>. <b>Users</b> in <b>Moodle</b> can send private messages to each other.
</p>

71
00:09:27 --> 00:09:32
I do not want my messages to be delivered as email, even when I am <b>offline</b>.

72
00:09:33 --> 00:09:39
Look at the <b>online</b> and offline help box and ensure that the settings are correct.
