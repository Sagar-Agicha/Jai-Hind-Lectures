00:00:01 --> 00:00:07
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Blocks in Admin's Dashboard</b>.

2
00:00:08 --> 00:00:17
In this tutorial, we will learn how to add and delete <b>blocks</b> and set the <b>Front page</b>.

3
00:00:18 --> 00:00:25
To record this tutorial, I am using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>, 
</p>

4
00:00:26 --> 00:00:34
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,

5
00:00:35 --> 00:00:40
<b>Moodle 3.3 </b>and  <b>Firefox </b>web browser.

6
00:00:41 --> 00:00:53
You may use any web browser of your choice.
<p>However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies. 
</p>

7
00:00:54 --> 00:01:07
Learners of this tutorial should have basic knowledge of the <b>Admin’s dashboard</b>.
<p>If not, please refer to the relevant<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website. 
</p>

8
00:01:08 --> 00:01:16
Switch to the browser and open your <b>Moodle site.</b>
<p>Make sure that the <b>XAMPP service</b> is running. 
</p>

9
00:01:17 --> 00:01:21
Login with your <b>admin username</b> and <b>password</b> details.

10
00:01:22 --> 00:01:25
We are now in the <b>Admin’s dashboard.</b>

11
00:01:26 --> 00:01:37
Recall that <b>Blocks</b> serve a specific purpose or information and are found on all pages of <b>Moodle</b>.

12
00:01:38 --> 00:01:43
Let us understand how we can work with <b>Moodle Blocks</b> now.

13
00:01:44 --> 00:01:51
Depending on the <b>theme</b> used, <b>blocks</b> can be on the right side or on both sides.

14
00:01:52 --> 00:01:57
<b>Blocks</b> contain information we want people to see whenever they log in.

15
00:01:58 --> 00:02:08
There are many types of <b>blocks</b> available in <b>Moodle.</b> And, they can be moved or arranged easily as per our preferences.

16
00:02:09 --> 00:02:13
We will now add a few <b>blocks</b> to our <b>dashboard</b>.

17
00:02:14 --> 00:02:18
Click on the <b>navigation menu </b>on the left of the page.

18
00:02:19 --> 00:02:25
Click on <b>Customise this page</b> button on the right hand side of the <b>dashboard</b>.

19
00:02:26 --> 00:02:34
Notice that a new menu item <b>Add a block</b> is visible now. Click on <b>Add a block</b>.

20
00:02:35 --> 00:02:42
A new pop-up <b>window</b> opens. We need to select the type of <b>block</b> that we want to add.

21
00:02:43 --> 00:02:52
For example, click on <b>Messages</b>. You can see that the <b>Messages block </b>now appears in the <b>dashboard</b>.

22
00:02:53 --> 00:02:55
Currently there are no messages.

23
00:02:56 --> 00:03:01
By default, all new <b>blocks </b>get added to the right-most column.

24
00:03:02 --> 00:03:08
Let us add one more <b>block</b>. Click on <b>Add a block </b>menu on the left.

25
00:03:09 --> 00:03:18
Select <b>HTML</b> from the list of <b>menu types</b>.
<p><b>HTML block</b> is a <b>block</b> where one can write custom <b>HTML</b>. 
</p>

26
00:03:19 --> 00:03:29
Using this, we can embed <b>widgets</b> such as <b>Library widgets, News feeds, Twitter, Facebook</b> etc.

27
00:03:30 --> 00:03:36
Notice now that a <b>NEW HTML BLOCK</b> has been added below the <b>Messages block</b>.

28
00:03:37 --> 00:03:45
Click on the gear icon in the <b>HTML block</b>.
<p>Then click on <b>Configure (NEW HTML BLOCK) block</b>. 
</p>

29
00:03:46 --> 00:03:56
<b>Configure HTML block</b> has 3 sections:
<p><b>Block settings</b> ,  <b>Where this block appears </b>and <b>On this page</b>. 
</p>

30
00:03:57 --> 00:04:01
By default, the first section is expanded.

31
00:04:02 --> 00:04:06
Click on <b>Expand all</b> to expand all the sections.

32
00:04:07 --> 00:04:11
In the <b>Block title</b>, let’s type: <b>“Things to do”.</b>

33
00:04:12 --> 00:04:18
Let us add some tasks for this <b>admin user</b> in the <b>Content</b> area.

34
00:04:19 --> 00:04:29
Type the following: <b>Create a new course</b>,  <b>Create new users</b>,  <b>Add users to the course</b>.

35
00:04:30 --> 00:04:38
The <b>editor</b> is an <b>HTML editor</b> and can be used like any other <b>word processor </b>or <b>editor</b>.

36
00:04:39 --> 00:04:44
Scroll down to see the options under <b>Where this block appears</b>.

37
00:04:45 --> 00:04:53
Under <b>Default region</b>, select <b>Content</b>.
<p>In <b>Default weight</b>, select -10 (minus ten). 
</p>

38
00:04:54 --> 00:05:02
The lower the weight of a <b>block</b>, the higher it will appear in that region.
<p>-10 (minus ten) is the lowest. 
</p>

39
00:05:03 --> 00:05:11
By selecting -10, I am ensuring that it is at the top of the <b>content </b>region.

40
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
This <b>block </b> will appear on the <b>Admin’s dashboard. </b>

41
00:05:17 --> 00:05:27
Now comes the <b>“On this page”</b> section.
<p>This is where you can define the configuration for the page where this <b>block</b> was added. 
</p>

42
00:05:28 --> 00:05:39
In our case, this is the <b>dashboard.</b>
<p>This configuration will override the default configuration defined in the above section 
</p>

43
00:05:40 --> 00:05:52
that is, the <b>Where this block appears </b>section.
<p>Let us select <b>Content</b> in <b>Region </b>and -10 (minus ten) in <b>Weight</b> in this section. 
</p>

44
00:05:53 --> 00:06:00
Please note that depending on the type of the <b>block</b>, configuration settings will vary.

45
00:06:01 --> 00:06:06
Click <b>Save Changes</b> to save the changes and go back to the <b>dashboard</b>.

46
00:06:07 --> 00:06:17
See that the new <b>HTML block</b> with the title <b>Things to do </b>is now visible.
<p>And, it is the topmost <b>block</b> in the <b>content </b>region. 
</p>

47
00:06:18 --> 00:06:24
We can also change the position of a <b>block</b> by dragging it using the <b>Move </b>icon.

48
00:06:25 --> 00:06:33
Let us move <b>Things to do block</b> below the <b>Course Overview block</b> by dragging and dropping it.

49
00:06:34 --> 00:06:39
Let us see how this changes the configuration we set a few minutes back.

50
00:06:40 --> 00:06:48
Click on the gear icon and then on <b>Configure Things to do block.</b>
<p>Then click on <b>Expand All</b>. 
</p>

51
00:06:49 --> 00:07:02
Scroll down to see <b>“On this page” </b>section. The <b>weight</b> has changed to -2 (minus two).
<p>The default <b>weight</b>, however, remains the same. 
</p>

52
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
Click <b>Cancel</b> to go back to the <b>dashboard</b>.

53
00:07:07 --> 00:07:18
We do not need this <b>Learning Plans block</b>. So let us delete it.
<p>Click on the gear icon and then on <b>Delete Learning plans block</b>. 
</p>

54
00:07:19 --> 00:07:28
<b>Confirm</b> pop-up window appears and prompts us to make sure about this deletion.
<p>Click on<b> Yes</b> button here. 
</p>

55
00:07:29 --> 00:07:39
Notice that the <b>Learning Plans block</b> is no longer available.
<p>We can always add this <b>block</b> later if required. 
</p>

56
00:07:40 --> 00:07:45
Let us now customize the <b>front page</b> of our <b>Moodle</b> installation.

57
00:07:46 --> 00:07:50
Click on <b>Site Administration</b> link on the left menu.

58
00:07:51 --> 00:07:59
Scroll down to locate <b>Front Page settings</b> in the <b>Front page</b> section. Click on it.

59
00:08:00 --> 00:08:07
Let us change the <b>Full Site Name </b>to <b>Digital India Learning Management System</b>.

60
00:08:08 --> 00:08:14
This is the text that appears at the top of every page above the <b>breadcrumbs</b>.

61
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
<b>Short name</b> is the text that appears in the title of the page.

62
00:08:20 --> 00:08:28
Notice that the title of this page is <b>Digital India LMS</b> followed by the name of the page we are in.

63
00:08:29 --> 00:08:39
<b>Short name</b> is also used as a <b>logo</b> text if we do not provide any logo image. We will leave it as it is.

64
00:08:40 --> 00:08:49
Scroll down to see drop-downs for <b>Front page</b> items.
<p>These are the list of items that can be shown on the front page. 
</p>

65
00:08:50 --> 00:08:56
All visitors, whether they are logged in or not, can see these items.

66
00:08:57 --> 00:09:04
The order is determined by a combination box. We will leave this as it is.

67
00:09:05 --> 00:09:12
So, all users will be able to see the list of courses (if available) and nothing else.

68
00:09:13 --> 00:09:23
Next is the <b>Front page items when logged in.</b>
<p>This is the list of items that can be shown to the users who are logged in. 
</p>

69
00:09:24 --> 00:09:28
Let us select <b>Enrolled courses</b> in the first drop-down.

70
00:09:29 --> 00:09:34
We will leave the rest of the options with their default values.

71
00:09:35 --> 00:09:39
Scroll down and click on <b>Save Changes</b>.

72
00:09:40 --> 00:09:42
Let us now summarize.

73
00:09:43 --> 00:09:53
In this tutorial, we learnt to add an <b>HTML block</b> called <b>“Things to do”</b> and specified where it should appear on the page.

74
00:09:54 --> 00:09:59
We also set up the <b>frontpage</b> for guests and logged-in users.

75
00:10:00 --> 00:10:13
Here is an assignment for you:
<p>Delete the <b>Private files block </b>. 
</p><p>Add a new <b>HTML block</b> using the guidelines given in the <b>Code files</b> link. 
</p>
