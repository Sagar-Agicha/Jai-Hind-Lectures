00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Categories in Moodle</b>.

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:19
In this tutorial, we will learn about:
<p><b>Course category</b>,
</p><p>how to create <b>categories & subcategories</b>,
</p><p>how to perform actions on <b>categories</b>.
</p>

3
00:00:20 --> 00:00:42
To record this tutorial, I will be using:
<p><b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,
</p><p><b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,
</p><p><b>Moodle 3.3</b> and <b>Firefox </b>web browser. 
</p>

4
00:00:43 --> 00:00:46
You can use any web browser of your choice.

5
00:00:47 --> 00:00:54
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided, as it causes some display inconsistencies.

6
00:00:55 --> 00:01:01
Learners of this tutorial should have <b>Moodle 3.3</b> installed on their system.

7
00:01:02 --> 00:01:08
If not, please refer to the relevant<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

8
00:01:09 --> 00:01:17
Switch to the browser and open your '<b>Moodle' homepage</b>. Make sure that the <b>XAMPP service</b> is running.

9
00:01:18 --> 00:01:22
Login with your <b>admin username</b> and <b>password</b> details.

10
00:01:23 --> 00:01:25
We are now in the <b>admin dashboard</b>.

11
00:01:26 --> 00:01:30
On the left side, click on <b>Site Administration</b>.

12
00:01:31 --> 00:01:37
Click on the <b>Courses</b> tab and then <b>Manage courses and categories</b>.

13
00:01:38 --> 00:01:49
We will be directed to a page with the title <b>Course and category management</b>. Let us understand what a <b>course category</b> is.

14
00:01:50 --> 00:01:56
<b>Course categories </b>help to organize <b>Moodle courses</b> for the <b>site</b> users.

15
00:01:57 --> 00:02:02
The default <b>category</b> for a new <b>Moodle site </b>is <b>Miscellaneous</b>.

16
00:02:03 --> 00:02:08
Any new <b>course</b> will be assigned to this <b>Miscellaneous category, </b>by default.

17
00:02:09 --> 00:02:15
However, it will be difficult for teachers and students to find their <b>courses</b>.

18
00:02:16 --> 00:02:22
To make it easier to locate <b>courses</b>, they should be assigned in <b>categories</b>.

19
00:02:23 --> 00:02:29
Most institutions organize <b>courses </b>by campus or <b>department</b>.

20
00:02:30 --> 00:02:34
It is good to have descriptive names for better clarity.

21
00:02:35 --> 00:02:46
We will go ahead and organize our <b>courses </b>by <b>departments</b>.
<p>For eg. our <b>Maths category</b> will have all the <b>Math courses.</b>
</p>

22
00:02:47 --> 00:02:50
Let us switch back to the <b>Moodle site</b>.

23
00:02:51 --> 00:02:56
First we will understand the <b>Course and category management </b>page layout.

24
00:02:57 --> 00:03:04
On the left, we have the <b>Navigation</b> block. And on the right, we have the <b>Content </b>region.

25
00:03:05 --> 00:03:19
The <b>content </b>region is divided into 2 <b>column</b>s:
<p>left column shows the <b>course categories</b>, 
</p><p>right column shows all the <b>courses</b> under the selected <b>category</b>. 
</p>

26
00:03:20 --> 00:03:25
By default, it is showing <b>courses </b>under <b>Miscellaneous category</b>.

27
00:03:26 --> 00:03:31
This view can be changed from the menu located at the right.

28
00:03:32 --> 00:03:35
Click on the down arrow to see the options.

29
00:03:36 --> 00:03:44
Now click on <b>Course categories</b>. This changes the view to show only the <b>course categories</b>.

30
00:03:45 --> 00:03:53
Let us click on the arrow again and change the view to see only the <b>courses</b>.
<p>Click on <b>Courses</b>.
</p>

31
00:03:54 --> 00:04:01
Notice that a new drop-down box has appeared now. This is the <b>category</b> drop-down.

32
00:04:02 --> 00:04:12
Here, we can select the <b>category</b> for which we want to show the <b>courses</b>.
<p>Currently, it only has the <b>Miscellaneous category.</b>
</p>

33
00:04:13 --> 00:04:18
Let us change the view back to<b> Course categories and courses</b>.

34
00:04:19 --> 00:04:25
Now we will click on <b>Create new category</b> link to add a <b>category</b>.

35
00:04:26 --> 00:04:35
Click on the<b> Parent category </b>dropdown box and select <b>Top</b>. Type: <b>Mathematics</b> in the <b>Category name</b>.

36
00:04:36 --> 00:04:46
<b>Category ID number </b>is an optional field. This is for admin users to identify the <b>course</b> with offline <b>courses</b>.

37
00:04:47 --> 00:04:57
If your college uses <b>ID</b> for <b>categories</b>, you can use that <b>category ID</b> here. This field is not visible to other <b>Moodle</b> users.

38
00:04:58 --> 00:05:02
For now, I will leave <b>Category ID</b> as blank.

39
00:05:03 --> 00:05:11
In the <b>Description</b> textbox, I will type-
<p>“<b>All mathematics courses will be listed under this category</b>.”
</p>

40
00:05:12 --> 00:05:16
Then click on <b>Create category</b> button.

41
00:05:17 --> 00:05:21
We are now in the <b>Course categories and courses </b>view.

42
00:05:22 --> 00:05:28
Here we can see 2 <b>categories</b> now: <b>Miscellaneous</b> and <b>Mathematics</b>.

43
00:05:29 --> 00:05:39
Let us organize these <b>categories</b> further.  Let us have separate <b>1st year Maths courses</b> and <b>2nd year Maths courses</b>.

44
00:05:40 --> 00:05:48
For this, we will create a <b>subcategory </b>called <b>1st Year Maths</b>, inside the <b>Mathematics category</b>.

45
00:05:49 --> 00:05:55
Click on<b> Create new category</b> link at the top of the listed <b>categories</b>.

46
00:05:56 --> 00:06:01
Creation of the <b>subcategory</b> is same as that of a <b>category</b>.

47
00:06:02 --> 00:06:05
Don’t select <b>Top </b>as the <b>parent category</b>.

48
00:06:06 --> 00:06:11
Instead, select the <b>category </b>under which this <b>subcategory </b>should belong.

49
00:06:12 --> 00:06:17
So here, we will type: <b>1st Year Maths</b> in the <b>category name.</b>

50
00:06:18 --> 00:06:25
After that, we’ll type a <b>Description</b> and click on <b>Create category </b>button.

51
00:06:26 --> 00:06:31
Notice that the <b>categories</b> on the left are listed in a <b>tree</b> format.

52
00:06:32 --> 00:06:40
A <b>category</b> which has <b>subcategories</b> has a <b>toggle icon</b> to expand and collapse it.

53
00:06:41 --> 00:06:45
Notice 3 icons on the right of the <b>category</b>.

54
00:06:46 --> 00:06:49
Hover over the icons to see what they are.

55
00:06:50 --> 00:06:52
The eye is for hiding the <b>category</b>.

56
00:06:53 --> 00:06:59
A hidden <b>category</b> will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.

57
00:07:00 --> 00:07:11
The arrow is for moving the <b>category </b>up or down.
<p>It also has a <b>settings gear </b>icon which is a <b>menu</b>, as shown by the down arrow.
</p>

58
00:07:12 --> 00:07:27
Click on the <b>settings gear</b> icon for <b>Miscellaneous category.</b>  It has options such as <b>Edit, Create new subcategory, Delete </b>etc. related to the <b>category</b>.

59
00:07:28 --> 00:07:31
Click elsewhere on the page to close this menu.

60
00:07:32 --> 00:07:38
Let me collapse the navigation menu on the left for better view.

61
00:07:39 --> 00:07:44
Next, click on the <b>settings gear</b> icon for<b> Mathematics category. </b>

62
00:07:45 --> 00:07:53
Notice that there are 4 extra <b>submenus</b> here related to sorting of the <b>subcategories</b>.

63
00:07:54 --> 00:08:00
All <b>categories</b> that have <b>subcategories</b> will have these menu items.

64
00:08:01 --> 00:08:08
The number to the right of the <b>gear</b> icon indicates the number of <b>courses</b> in that <b>category</b>.

65
00:08:09 --> 00:08:13
There are sorting options below the list of <b>categories</b>.

66
00:08:14 --> 00:08:20
At the end, is the option to change the <b>parent category</b> of a <b>subcategory.</b>

67
00:08:21 --> 00:08:28
To use this option, you have to check the check-box next to the <b>subcategory</b> you want to move.

68
00:08:29 --> 00:08:37
Then select the new <b>parent category</b> and click on <b>Move</b>.  We will not use this option right now.

69
00:08:38 --> 00:08:43
This brings us to the end of this tutorial.
