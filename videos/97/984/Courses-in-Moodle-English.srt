<i><b>Narration</b></i>

1
00:00:01 --> 00:00:05
Welcome to the <b>Spoken Tutorial</b> on <b>Courses in Moodle.</b>

2
00:00:06 --> 00:00:15
In this tutorial, we will learn:
<p>how to create a <b>course </b>and how to perform actions on <b>courses.</b>
</p>

3
00:00:16 --> 00:00:23
To record this tutorial, I will be using: <b>Ubuntu Linux OS 16.04</b>,

4
00:00:24 --> 00:00:37
<b>Apache, MariaDB </b>and<b> PHP</b> obtained through<b> XAMPP 5.6.30</b>,
<p><b>Moodle 3.3</b>  and <b>Firefox </b>web browser. 
</p>

5
00:00:38 --> 00:00:41
You can use any web browser of your choice.

6
00:00:42 --> 00:00:49
However, <b>Internet Explorer</b> should be avoided as it causes some display inconsistencies.

7
00:00:50 --> 00:00:55
Learners of this tutorial should know how to create <b>categories</b> in <b>Moodle</b>.

8
00:00:56 --> 00:01:02
If not, please refer to the relevant<b> Moodle</b> tutorials on this website.

9
00:01:03 --> 00:01:10
Switch to the browser and open your <b>Moodle homepage</b>.
<p>Make sure that <b>XAMPP service</b> is running.
</p>

10
00:01:11 --> 00:01:15
Login with your <b>admin username</b> and <b>password</b> details.

11
00:01:16 --> 00:01:18
We are now in the <b>admin dashboard</b>.

12
00:01:19 --> 00:01:24
Click on the drawer menu to open the navigation menu on the left.

13
00:01:25 --> 00:01:28
On the left side, click on <b>Site Administration</b>.

14
00:01:29 --> 00:01:35
Click on the <b>Courses</b> tab and then on <b>Manage courses and categories</b>.

15
00:01:36 --> 00:01:40
Note that we have only one <b>category </b>here which is <b>Mathematics.</b>

16
00:01:41 --> 00:01:49
And two <b>subcategories: 1st Year Maths </b>and <b>2nd Year Maths </b>which we created earlier.

17
00:01:50 --> 00:01:54
Now, let us create a new <b>course</b> under <b>Mathematics</b>.

18
00:01:55 --> 00:01:58
So, click on <b>Create new course</b>.

19
00:01:59 --> 00:02:11
And, in the <b>Add a new course</b> screen, click on <b>Expand All </b>at the top right, in order to view all the <b>field</b>s.

20
00:02:12 --> 00:02:17
In the <b>Course full name</b> text-box, we will type <b>Calculus.</b>

21
00:02:18 --> 00:02:23
In <b>Course short name</b>, we will again type <b>Calculus</b>.

22
00:02:24 --> 00:02:30
<b>Course short name</b> will be used in the <b>breadcrumbs</b> and <b>course</b> related emails.

23
00:02:31 --> 00:02:34
This can also be different from the <b>course full name</b>.

24
00:02:35 --> 00:02:39
<b>Course Category</b> is <b>Mathematics,</b> as we can see.

25
00:02:40 --> 00:02:47
Next option is<b> Course visibility. </b>By default, <b>Show</b> is selected.

26
00:02:48 --> 00:02:55
The <b>Visible</b> setting determines whether the <b>course</b> will be shown along with other <b>courses</b> or not.

27
00:02:56 --> 00:03:07
A hidden <b>course</b> is visible only to those assigned to the <b>course</b>, like- <b>Admin</b>, <b>Course creator</b>, <b>Teacher</b>, <b>Manager</b>.

28
00:03:08 --> 00:03:11
We will leave this setting as it is, for now.

29
00:03:12 --> 00:03:15
Next comes the <b>Course start date</b>.

30
00:03:16 --> 00:03:24
If the <b>course</b> begins on a particular date like semester start date, select that in the <b>start date</b>.

31
00:03:25 --> 00:03:31
This means the <b>course</b> will not be visible to the students till the <b>start date</b>.

32
00:03:32 --> 00:03:41
<b>Course end date,</b> by default, is enabled and set to the same date that the course is created.

33
00:03:42 --> 00:03:50
Let me disable it by clicking on the checkbox. This would mean that the <b>course</b> will never end.

34
00:03:51 --> 00:04:01
However, if there is an end date for the <b>course</b>, you can enable the checkbox here.
<p>Then select the date as per your requirement.
</p>

35
00:04:02 --> 00:04:12
Important note: The <b>course</b> will not be visible to the students after the selected <b>end date</b>.
<p>I will leave it disabled. 
</p>

36
00:04:13 --> 00:04:21
<b>Course ID number </b>is similar to <b>Category ID number</b>.
<p><b>Course ID number </b>is an optional <b>field</b>. 
</p>

37
00:04:22 --> 00:04:27
This is for admin users to identify the <b>course </b>with <b>offline courses</b>.

38
00:04:28 --> 00:04:39
If your college uses <b>IDs</b> for <b>courses</b>, then you can use that <b>course ID </b>here.
<p>This field is not visible to other <b>Moodle users</b>.
</p>

39
00:04:40 --> 00:04:48
This field is optional and is not displayed anywhere on the website. I am going to leave this as blank.

40
00:04:49 --> 00:04:58
Next, under <b>Description</b>, we can see 2 fields: <b>Course Summary</b> and <b>Course Summary files</b>.

41
00:04:59 --> 00:05:12
<b>Course summary</b> is an optional but important field. That is because the <b>course summary</b> text is also scanned when a <b>user</b> performs a search.

42
00:05:13 --> 00:05:28
Listing topic names is a good idea here.
<p>Type the following:<b>Topics covered in this Calculus course are:</b> <b>Limits</b>,<b>Graph of a function</b>, <b>Factorial</b>.
</p>

43
00:05:29 --> 00:05:34
<b>Course summary </b>is also displayed along with the list of <b>courses</b>.

44
00:05:35 --> 00:05:41
<b>Course summary files</b> must be uploaded in <b>Course summary files</b> field.

45
00:05:42 --> 00:05:56
By default, only <b>jpg, gif</b> and <b>png file types</b> are allowed as <b>course summary files.</b>
<p>I will skip this as I do not wish to <b>upload</b> any file.
</p>

46
00:05:57 --> 00:06:05
<b>Course format</b> refers to the way resources and activities are organized for students.

47
00:06:06 --> 00:06:19
There are 4 options in the <b>Format</b> dropdown -
<p><b>Single Activity Format</b>, <b>Social Format</b>, <b>Topics Format </b>and <b>Weekly Format</b>. 
</p>

48
00:06:20 --> 00:06:23
There are <b>courses</b> that run week by week.

49
00:06:24 --> 00:06:29
If your <b>course</b> is like that, then select <b>Weekly format</b>.

50
00:06:30 --> 00:06:38
<b>Moodle</b> will create a section for each week of the <b>course, </b>with a clear start date and an end date.

51
00:06:39 --> 00:06:48
There are <b>courses</b> that run topic wise. If your <b>course</b> is like that, then select <b>Topics   format</b>.

52
00:06:49 --> 00:06:54
<b>Moodle</b> will create a section for each <b>topic</b> of the <b>course</b>.

53
00:06:55 --> 00:07:02
The default for this field is <b>Topics format</b>. We will let it remain as it is.

54
00:07:03 --> 00:07:06
The number of sections, by default, is 4.

55
00:07:07 --> 00:07:19
If you have your <b>course</b> divided in more or less than 4 topics, change this field as required.
<p>I will make this number as 5.
</p>

56
00:07:20 --> 00:07:24
We will discuss the other formats in later tutorials.

57
00:07:25 --> 00:07:35
Letâ€™s leave the rest of the options as they are.
<p>Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the <b>Save and display </b>button.
</p>

58
00:07:36 --> 00:07:45
We are redirected to the <b>Enrolled Users</b> page. We will learn about <b>user enrollment </b>in a later tutorial.

59
00:07:46 --> 00:07:55
For now, we have successfully created our first <b>course Calculus </b>under the <b>category Mathematics</b>.

60
00:07:56 --> 00:08:02
While we are on this <b>course page</b>, notice that the menu on the left has changed.

61
00:08:03 --> 00:08:14
The navigation menu on the left has menus related to the <b>course</b> we created.
<p>These include <b>Participants</b>, <b>Grades</b> etc.
</p>

62
00:08:15 --> 00:08:19
Click on the course name <b>Calculus</b> on the left.

63
00:08:20 --> 00:08:33
We can see that 5 topics are visible here. They are named <b>Topic 1, Topic 2</b> and so on.
<p>Recall we had given this number 5 earlier.
</p>

64
00:08:34 --> 00:08:38
Click on the gear icon at the top right of the page.

65
00:08:39 --> 00:08:50
Then click on <b>Edit settings</b>.
<p>This will open a page similar to the page we were on, when we created this <b>course</b>.
</p>

66
00:08:51 --> 00:09:03
We can make changes to the previous settings on this page.
<p>I will change the <b>Course start date</b> to 15th October 2017.
</p>

67
00:09:04 --> 00:09:10
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and click on the <b>Save and display</b> button.

68
00:09:11 --> 00:09:16
We will explore the other sub-menus under the gear menu later.

69
00:09:17 --> 00:09:21
Let us now change the structure of our <b>course</b> a little bit.

70
00:09:22 --> 00:09:30
Click on <b>Site administration</b>.
<p>Click on <b>Courses</b> and then <b>Manage courses and categories</b>.
</p>

71
00:09:31 --> 00:09:41
Click on <b>Mathematics category</b> to see the <b>course</b> we created. Notice 3 icons on the right of the <b>course</b>.

72
00:09:42 --> 00:09:45
Hover over the icons to see what they are.

73
00:09:46 --> 00:09:54
The gear icon is for editing a <b>course.</b> The <b>delete</b> or <b>trash</b> icon is for deleting a <b>course</b>.

74
00:09:55 --> 00:10:00
And, the eye icon is for hiding a <b>course</b>.

75
00:10:01 --> 00:10:06
A hidden <b>course</b> will have the eye crossed to indicate the same.

76
00:10:07 --> 00:10:13
We can click on the gear icon to the right of the course name, to edit the <b>course settings</b>.

77
00:10:14 --> 00:10:24
I want to modify the <b>Course Summary</b> and add <b>Binomials</b> to the existing topics.
<p>Rest of the settings can remain the same.
</p>

78
00:10:25 --> 00:10:33
Scroll down to the bottom of the page and this time click on the <b>Save and return</b> button.

79
00:10:34 --> 00:10:43
Here is a small assignment for you: create a new course <b>Linear Algebra </b>under the <b>category Mathematics</b>.

80
00:10:44 --> 00:10:46
Hide this <b>course</b> for now.

81
00:10:47 --> 00:10:59
Mention the following topics in <b>course summary: Linear equations, Matrices </b>and<b> Vectors</b>.
<p>Click on <b>Save and Return </b>button.
</p>

82
00:11:00 --> 00:11:05
Pause the tutorial and continue when done with the assignment.

83
00:11:06 --> 00:11:13
We now have 2 <b>courses</b> under <b>Mathematics</b>: <b>Calculus</b> and <b>Linear Algebra</b>.

84
00:11:14 --> 00:11:19
Notice that a new icon has appeared next to the <b>courses</b> now.

85
00:11:20 --> 00:11:25
The up and down arrows are to re-arrange the order of the <b>courses</b>.

86
00:11:26 --> 00:11:35
We can also change the order using the drag and drop feature.
<p>Let us move the <b>Calculus course</b> above the <b>Linear Algebra course.</b>
</p>

87
00:11:36 --> 00:11:46
Both these <b>courses</b> are for 1st year students.
<p>So, let us move them under the<b> 1st Year Maths</b> subcategory.
</p>

88
00:11:47 --> 00:11:52
Check the checkbox to the left of the 2 <b>courses</b> in order to select them.

89
00:11:53 --> 00:12:01
Then in the drop-down <b>Move selected courses to</b>, select <b>Mathematics / 1st year Maths</b>.

90
00:12:02 --> 00:12:03
And click on the <b>Move</b> button.

91
00:12:04 --> 00:12:13
We get a success message -<b>Successfully moved 2 courses into 1st year Maths</b>.

92
00:12:14 --> 00:12:23
Note that the number of <b>courses</b> under <b>Mathematics</b> has become 0 and that under <b>1st year Maths </b>is 2.

93
00:12:24 --> 00:12:27
Click on <b>1st year Maths</b> sub-category.

94
00:12:28 --> 00:12:32
We can see our <b>courses</b> listed under this subcategory.

95
00:12:33 --> 00:12:37
This brings us to the end of this tutorial. Let us summarize.

96
00:12:38 --> 00:12:49
In this tutorial, we learnt: how to create <b>a course</b>,
<p>how to perform actions like <b>edit, move,</b> etc. on <b>courses</b>.
</p>

97
00:12:50 --> 00:12:59
Here is an assignment for you:
<p>Add 2 <b>courses </b>to the subcategory <b>2nd Year Maths </b>under<b> Mathematics, </b>namely-
